This is a proposed explanation of how and why Canada's economy has grown and changed since [[Confederation]]

What is a 'staple' product?
- A natural resource that can be exploited relatively quickly and cheaply for profit

The regional economic history of Canda was linked to the discovery, utilization, and export of staple resources in Canada's peripheral regions

Eventually, economic diversification occured thus making peripheral regions less reliant on natural resources.

The Thesis was proposed by Harold Innis in the early 1930s

The atlantic provinces were the first region to be settled and in its early history it was a periphery for england.

Throughout Canada's history, there has been an east-to-west progression of the most important economic staples.

### Progression:
1. Fur
2. Lumber (progressing from east to west)
3. Fish (East)
4. Mining (East to West)
5. Oil (West)
