## Histograms
- For large datasets and/or quantitative variables that take many values
- Divide the possible values into classes, or intervals of equal width
- Count how many observations fall into each interval. Instead of counts you can also use percents
- Draw a picture representing the distribution. each bar height is equal to the number of observations in its interval
