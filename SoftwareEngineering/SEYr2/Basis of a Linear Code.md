A basis of a linear code C is a collection $\vec b_1,\cdots, \vec b_r$ with all in C 
so that if $\vec c\in C$ 
then there are $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_r$ each 0 or 1 with $\lambda_1\vec b_1 + \cdots + \lambda_r \vec b_r = \vec c$ and 
if $\lambda_1\vec b_1 + \cdots + \lambda_r \vec b_r = \vec 0$ then $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_r = 0$

So a basis of a linear code is just like a [[basis]] of a [[subspace]] in linear algebra

Ex. $\{(1,0,0,0), (0,0,0,1)\}$ is a basis of $\{(1,0,0,1),(1,0,0,0),(0,0,0,1),(0,0,0,0)\}$

==Every Linear Code has a Basis==
