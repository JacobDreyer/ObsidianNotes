There are two main types of random variables: Discrete and continuous.

If you can find a way to list all possible outcomes for a random variable and assign probabilities to each one, then you have a discrete random variable

A discrete random variable X takes a fixed set of possible values with gaps between. The probability distribution of X lists the values $x_i$ and their probabilities $p_i$: 
| Value:       | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Probability: | $p_1$ | $p_2$ | $p_3$ |

The probabilities $p_i$ must satisfy two requirements:
1. Every probabilty $p_i$ is a number between 0 and 1
2. The Sum of the probabilities is 1

To find the probability of any event, add the probabilities $p_i$ of the paticular values $x_i$ that make up the event
