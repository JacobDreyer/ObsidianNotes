A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that is punctuated as if it were complete. 

Example:
While I was apple-picking. I saw...   (Fragment)
While I was apple-picking, I saw...   (Complete)

Complete Thought = [[Independent Clause]]
What Happened? = [[Dependent Clause]]
No subject or predicate = [[Phrase]]
