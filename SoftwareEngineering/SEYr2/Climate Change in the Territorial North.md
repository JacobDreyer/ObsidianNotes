Temperatures are expected to warm more in polar regions than any other regions on [[Earth]].

Summers are forecasted to mostly be ice-free in [[The Arctic Ocean]] and [[Hudson Bay]] by [[2050]]

The populations of [[Polar Bear]]s and [[Caribou]] will likely be greatly reduced

Melting ice and snow leads to even more warming; this is an example of a [[Positive Feedback Cycle]]

### Loss of Sea Ice
By [[2050]], the only remaining [[Arctic Sea Ice]] in Summer is expected to be around [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Northern Greenland]]

Since [[1980]], [[Arctic Sea Ice]] in summer has declined by 30%
