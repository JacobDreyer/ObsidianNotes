the claim tested by a statistical test (ex. [[Tests of Significance]]) is called the null hypothesis ($H_0$). The test is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. Often the null hypothesis is a statement of "no effect" or "no difference in the true means."

The claim about the [[Population]] for which we are trying to find evidence is the ==alternative hypothesis== ($H_A$) 

The alternative is one-sided if it states either that a [[Parameter]] is larger than the null hypothesis value or that it is smaller than the null hypothesis value

It is two-sided if it states that the parameter is different from the null value
