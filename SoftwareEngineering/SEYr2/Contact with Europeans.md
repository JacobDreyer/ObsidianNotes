European explorers considered [[The New World]] (The western hemisphere) terra nullius (empty lands)

Contact between Europeans and [[Indigenous People]] occured in Canada from the late 1400's through the 1500's

Just before first contact there may have been as many as 500,000 Indigenous people living in Canada. By 1871, the Indigenous population has declined by 80% as a result.

Contributions to this population decline:
- Spread of new diseases by explorers and fur traders
- Loss of hunting grounds to European settlers
