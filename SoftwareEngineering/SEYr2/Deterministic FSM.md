An FSM is deterministic if every combination of current state and input leads one and only one state transition

a FSM is non-deterministic if receiving a paticular input while in a paticular state allows more than one transition. Usually the transition is probabilistic

A non-deterministic FSM can usually be converted to a deterministic FSM by expanding the number of states.
