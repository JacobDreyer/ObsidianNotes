## Box Plots
- The median and quartiles divide the distribution roughly into quarters. 
- This lead to a new way to display quantitative data, the boxplot

- Draw and label a number line that includes the range of the distribution
- Draw a central box from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$ ([[Describing Distributions]])
- Note the median inside the box
- Extend lines from the box out to the minimum and maximum values
