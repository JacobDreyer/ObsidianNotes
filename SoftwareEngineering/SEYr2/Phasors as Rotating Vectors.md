- Consider a sinusoidal voltage given by:
$$ v(t) = V_m\cos(\omega t+\theta) $$
- We can write this voltage as:
$$ v(t) = Re[V_me^{j(\omega t+\theta)}] $$
- The complex quanitity inside the bracket is
$$ V_me^{j(\omega t+\theta)} = V_m\angle\omega t+\theta $$
This can be thought of as a vector of length $V_m$ that rotates counterclockwise in the complex plane with an angluar velocity of $\omega$ radians/sec

- The voltage v(t) is the real part of the vector which is illustrated in the Figure
- As the vector rotates, it's Projection on the real axis traces the voltage as a function of time
- The phasor is simply a snapshot of this rotating vector at t=0
