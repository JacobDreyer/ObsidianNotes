We use Pronouns to stand in and refer back to other nouns

##### Ex:
"Where are the apples?"
"They are in the bowl"

"they" functions as a pronoun replacing/referring to the [[Noun]] "apple"

Pronouns are noun substitutes, replacing, referring, or standing in place of [[Noun]]s

The nouns for which pronouns stand in place and to which they refer back are called [[antecedents]]
