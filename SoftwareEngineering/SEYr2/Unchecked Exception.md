## Unchecked Exceptions
- in most cases: reflect unrecoverable logic errors
	- [[NullPointerException]]: thrown when you try to access an object throught a reference variable before an object is assigned to it
	- [[IndexOutOfBoundsException]]: thrown if you access an element in an array outside the bounds of the array
- These are the logic errors that should be corrected in the program.
- java does not require you to write code to catch unchecked exceptions
