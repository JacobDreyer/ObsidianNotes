It involved the production of [[Hydroelectricty]] from all 20 rivers that flow into [[James Bay]] from [[Quebec]]

The First phase (La Grande) began in [[1972]] and was completed 13 years later at a cost of $14 billion

Construction required a new highway to [[Northern Quebec]] and a new community was created ([[Radisson]])

The project was one of the few hydroelectric developments that created controversy

[[Indigenous People]] (Primarily the [[Cree]]) and enviromental organizations were outspoken against the project.

Opposition from the [[Cree]] and [[Sierra Club]] influenced public opinion in the [[US]] since some states purchase power from [[Quebec]]

Those opposed to the project focused on a number of concerns:
- Flooding caused by the dams
- Loss of habitat for wildlife
- Loss of Timber
- Chemicals in the resevoirs affected fish that were eaten by the [[Cree]] and [[Inuit]]
- Impacts on animal migration patterns and Indigenous Hunting Grounds
