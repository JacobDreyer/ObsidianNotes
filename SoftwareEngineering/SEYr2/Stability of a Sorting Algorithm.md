- The question of stability in [[Sorting Algorithms]] arises when we wish to sort the same data-set more than once according to different keys
- The problem is the second sort might destroy the order set by the first sort if there are some duplicate second keys
- However this will not happen if the second sorting algorithm is a ==Stable Sorting Algorithm==
- ==A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the order of duplicate keys==
