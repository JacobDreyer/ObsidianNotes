Things happen 1 at a time. When you call a function that perform's a long-running action it returns only when the action has finished and it can return the result. This stops your program for the time the action takes.

The solution to this is to start additional threads of control. A thread is another running program whose execution may be interleaved with other programs by the operating system. Multi-threading requires context switching which can become very costly.
