We want to prove $p\to q$
1. Assume $\neg q$
2. Find some contradiction $d \land\neg d$
3. claim $\neg\neg q$ = q

Ex. Show that $\sqrt 2$ is irrational
c = $\sqrt 2$ is irrational
Assume $\sqrt2$ is rational
if $\sqrt2$ is rational than $\sqrt2 = \frac{c}d$ where (a and b are in lowest terms(d))
$$ 2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} $$
$$ 2b^2 = a^2 $$
$a^2$ is even -> a is even 
$$ 2b^2 = (2k)^2 $$
$$ 2b^2 = 4k^2 $$
$$ b^2 = 2k^2 $$
$b^2$ is even -> b is even

(we know a/b is not in lowest terms because if in lowest terms we could factor out a 2($\neg$d))
