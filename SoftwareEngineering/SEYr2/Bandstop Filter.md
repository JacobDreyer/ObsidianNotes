- The [[Transfer Function]] is given by:
$$ H(\omega) = \frac{V_0}{V_i} = \frac{j(\omega L - \frac1{\omega C})}{R + j(\omega L - \frac1{\omega C})} $$

- The centre frequency is given by:
$$ \omega_0 = \frac1{\sqrt {LC}} $$
- $\omega_0$ is refered to as the [[Frequency of Rejection]]
- $B = \omega_2 - \omega_1$ is refered to as the [[Bandwidth of Rejection]]
- The [[Half-Power Frequencies]], the [[Bandwidth]], and [[Quality Factor]] are given by:
$$ \omega_1 = -\frac R{2L} + \sqrt{(\frac R{2L})^2 + \frac1{LC}} $$
$$ \omega_2 = +\frac R{2L} + \sqrt{(\frac R{2L})^2 + \frac1{LC}} $$
$$ B = \omega_2 - \omega_1 = \frac RL = \frac{\omega_0}Q $$
$$ Q = \frac{\omega_0 L}R = \frac1{\omega_0 CR} $$
