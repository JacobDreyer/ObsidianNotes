##### Rule 1:
The Probability P(A) of any event A: $0\leq P(A)\leq 1$
##### Rule 2:
If S is the sample space in a probability model, then P(S) = 1
##### Rule 3:
If A and B are [[disjoint]], then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
##### Rule 4:
For any event A, P($A^c$) = 1-P(A)
*complement of A*
##### Rule 5:
if A and B are Independent ([[Independence]]) then P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
