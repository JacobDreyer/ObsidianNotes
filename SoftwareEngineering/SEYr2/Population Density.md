Number of people divided by land area 

Canada is the 2nd largest country in the world by land area

The population density of Canada is one of the lowest in the world (3.7 people per km squared)

However, Canada's physiological density (the amount of people per $km^2$ of arable land) is similar to that of the US

The inhabited part of an area is referred to as an ecumene

### Regional Population Density
Density varies greatly among the regions.
[[Ontario]] has the highest population density of the six regions (13 people per $km^2$)

This is despite [[Northern Ontario]] being very sparsely populated

Ontario and Quebec combined are home to 62% of Canada's population
