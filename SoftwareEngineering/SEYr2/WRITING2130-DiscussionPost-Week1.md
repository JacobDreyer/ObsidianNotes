12 -> 1 -> Mention 6 and 7 (speed is the same)

Mention point 8. transfer to point 9.

Finish off with point 11

As the public relations director for Boeing, I would want to introduce my argument with point 12. This point is likely to be Airbus' main selling point of the airplane and my following points can be used to discredit it. To accomplish that, I will bring up point 1 and follow up with points 6 and 7. This will bring up the inconvenience of the plane and lead readers to believe that there is limited benefit to the increased size. Finally, I would finish off with point 11 to direct readers to what we are working on instead. These points include Airbus' main selling point, why it may not be such a great thing, and what Boeing is doing instead. These points achieve our goal of selling our planes and by ordering them in this way, they take away from our competitor's points and direct consumers to our selling points.
