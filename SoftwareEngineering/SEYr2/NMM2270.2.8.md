1. The number N(t) of supermarkets throughout the country that are using a computerized checkout system is described by the initial-value problem
$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = N(1-.0005N), \qquad N(0)=1 $$
$$ \frac{1}{N(1-.0005N)}dN=dt $$
[[Partial Fraction Decomposition]]
$$  \frac{1}{N(1-.0005N)} = \frac AN+\frac{B}{1-.0005N}  $$
$$  1 = A(1-.0005N)+BN = A + (B-.0005A)N  $$
$$ A = 1, \quad B = .0005N $$
$$ \int\frac{1}{N}dN + \int\frac{.0005}{1-.0005N}dN = \int dt $$
$$ \ln|N| - \ln|1-.0005N| = t $$
$$ \ln|\frac{N}{1-.005N}|=t $$
$$ \frac{N}{1-.0005N} = e^t $$
```ad-note
Solution is right p sure just am dumb at simplifying

11. Two chemicals A and B are combined to form a chemical C. The rate, or velocity, of the reaction is proportional to the product of the instantaneous amounts of A and B not converted to chemical C. Initially there are 40 grams of A and 50 grams of B, and for each gram of B, 2 grams of A are used. It is observed that 10 grams of C are formed in 5 minutes. How much is formed in 20 minutes? What is the limiting amount of C after a long time? How much of chemicals A and B remains after a long time?

$$ C= m_1A + m_2B $$
$$ \frac{dC}{dt} = k_1A + k_2B $$
