- [[Modifier]]s = single words, phrases, even subordinate/dependent clauses that describe other words in a sentence
	- Ex. [[Adverb]]s and [[Adjective]]s are modifiers
- Modifier Problems happen when the placement of a modifier creates unintended or ambiguous meaning
- The modifier doesn't clearly point to the word or idea that the writer intends it to modify

- [[Limiting Modifier]]s = [[Adverb]]s that modify what follows them immediately
	- Ex. almost, even, exactly, hardly, just, merely, only, scarcely, not
- When these modifiers are placed too early in a sentence, it becomes unclear what they are modifying
	- Ex. The student almost washed 50 cars last saturday
	- Revised: The student washed almost 50 cars last saturday

- [[Misplaced Modifier]]s can also be whole [[Phrase]]s or [[Clause]]s
	- Ex. There are pictures of singers who have performed at this theatre ==on the walls==
	- Revised: On the walls, there are pictures of singers who have performed at this theatre.
- Misplaced Modifiers: [[Split Infinitives]]
	- [[Infinitive]] = to + root [[verb]]
	- Split Infinitive = to + [[Adverb]] + [[Verb]]

- [[Squinting Modifier]]s = word or [[phrase]] between two elements that could modify either one
	- Ex. It was so warm ==for a week== we did hardly any skiing at all
	- Revised: It was so warm that for a week we did hardly any skiing at all

- [[Dangling Modifier]]s = [[modifier]]s that have no word in the rest of the sentence to attach to
- Dangling Modifiers create illogical statements
- Usually, they are [[Phrase]]s that in introduce a sentence. The modifying phrase doesn't match up with the subject of the sentence
	- Ex. Upon entering the doctor's office, a skeleton caught my attention
	- Revised: Upon entering the doctor's office, ==i noticed== a skeleton
- How to Fix [[Dangling Modifier]]s:
	1. Name the actor in the modifier, or
	2. Keep the modifier the same and rewrite the main clause so subject in sentence is clear
