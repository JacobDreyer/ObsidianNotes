### Phases of Indigenous Population Growth in Canada

##### Pre-Contact
Population size varied depending on availibility of food, weather, and animal migrations

##### Early Contact ([[1500]] - [[1940]])
Exposure to new diseases and loss of hunting lands caused a decrease in population

##### Late Contact ([[1940]] - [[1960]])
Rising birth rates and relatively high death rates resulted in population stabilization

##### Post Contact ([[1960]] - present)
High birth rates and lower death rates result in population growth. The overall population now is nearly 1.9 million (from a low of 105,000 in 1910)
