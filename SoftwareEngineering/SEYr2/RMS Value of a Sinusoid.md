- Consider a sinusoidal voltage given by:
$$ v(t) = V_m\cos(\omega t + \theta) $$
- [[RMS]] value is given by:
$$ V_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac1T\int_0^TV_m^2\cos^2(\omega t + \theta)dt} = 
\frac{V_m}{\sqrt2} $$
- [[Residential AC Power]] in residential wiring is distributed as a 60hz 115-V (RMS) sinusoidal signal in [[Canada]] and the [[US]]
- The wave form of the signal supplied therefore can be represented as:
$$ v(t) = 115\times \sqrt2\sin(2\pi(60)t) $$
- The relationsip between [[RMS]] and peak value for sinusoidal signal is:
$$ V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt 2} $$
