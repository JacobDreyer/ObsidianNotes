In the early [[1800s]] European whalers set saill for [[Davis Strait]] and [[Baffin Bay]]

As explorers pushed farther west, it became necessary to spend the winter on the nearby land. So, they're pretty much living with the [[Inuit]]

Here, they met [[Inuit]] and a trading relationship developed between the two groups

[[Inuit]] would hunt and provide meat for the whalers in return for knives and rifles
