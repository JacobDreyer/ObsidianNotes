### Presence of Asian Automakers in [[Ontario]]
Currently, 60% of vehicles produced in [[North America]] are from one of [[The Big Three]]

Japanese-based companies such as [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] chose to build large plants in [[Ontario]]
in the [[1980s]] despite being lured by US jurisdictions at the time

Why?
- [[Ontario]] has a highly skilled automotive workforce
- Publicly funded health care is availible thus the auto companies do not need to pay for medical insurance for their employees
