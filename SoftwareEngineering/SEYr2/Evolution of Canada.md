Canada's history as a country began with [[The British North America Act]] passed on July 1 1867.

This act united the four original British colonies.

[[Manitoba]] then became a province in 1870 followed by [[British Columbia]] in 1871

Therefore, at that time Canada consisted of 6 provinces and 1 territory

The Four remaining provinces and 2 territories joined Canada in this order:
- [[PEI]] (1873)
- [[Yukon]] (1898)
- [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] (1905)
- [[Newfoundland]] (1949)
- [[Nunavut]] (1999)

After [[Confederation]], there were frequent changes in the boundaries of provinces and territories.

The greatest dispute was settled by impartial judicial court in England.

All land that drains into the Atlantic Ocean was awarded to [[Labrador]] (Which belonged to [[Newfoundland]] and was a British Colony at the time) (This land was very good for power generation)

Quebec has never formally accepted this ruling
