A poisson setting arises when we consider the number of successes that occur in a fixed unit of measure, such as a period of time or a region of space
ex. customers at a cafe between 1:00 and 2:00

#### Conditions:
1. The number of successes that occur in two non-overlapping units of measure are independent
2. The [[Probability]] that a success will occur in a unit of measure is the same for all units of equal size and is proportional to the size of the unit
3. The probability that more than one event occurs in a unit of measure is negligible for very small units. In other words the events occur one at a time
