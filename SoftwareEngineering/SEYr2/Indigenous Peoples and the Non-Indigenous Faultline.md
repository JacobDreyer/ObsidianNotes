### Newcomers to Manitoba
From 1870 to 1880, the [[Metis]] lost their majority in [[Manitoba]]  due to an influx of people from [[Ontario]]

What caused the influx?
- Ontario no longer had a surplus of agricultural land
- Wheat Farming in Manitoba became profitable due to advances in machinery and rising prices for grain
