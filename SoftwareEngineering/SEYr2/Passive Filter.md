- A [[Filter]] is a [[Circuit]] that is designed to pass signals with desired frequencies and reject or attenuate others
- Technological achievements would not have been possible without electrical filters
- Filters are the circuits used in radio and TV receivers to allow us to select one desired signal out of a multitude of broadcast signals in the enviroment
- There are 4 types of filters:
	- A [[Lowpass Passive Filter]] passes low frequencies and stops high frequencies
	- a [[Highpass Passive Filter]] pases high frequencies and stops low frequencies
	- a [[Bandpass Filter]] passes frequencies within a frequency band and blocks or attenuates frequencies outside the band
	- a [[Bandstop Filter]] passes frequencies outside a frequency band and blocks or attenuates frequencies inside the band
- Drawbacks of [[Passive Filter]]s
	- Passive Filters cannot generate gain greater than 1
	- Passive elements cannot add energy to the network
	- Passive filters may require bulky and expensive [[Inductor]]s
