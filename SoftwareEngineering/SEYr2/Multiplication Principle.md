The total number of possible outcomes for a ==sequence== of events is the product of the # of possible outcomes for each event.

For example if you have three actions:
- and 3 possibilities for the first action
- 2 possiblilites for the second action
- and 4 possibilities for the third action

The total number of combinations is:
$$ 3\times 2\times 4 = 24 $$
