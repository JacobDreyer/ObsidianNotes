[[The Laurentide Ice Sheet]] began retreating from Nunavut about 5000 years ago

After this point, groups of sea hunters were able to advance eastward and northward.

They hunted walruses, seals, and other marine animals.

[[The Thule People]] migrated to this area 1000 years ago. They are the ancestors to the current [[Inuit People]]

This has resulted in Nunavut being 80% inuit people
