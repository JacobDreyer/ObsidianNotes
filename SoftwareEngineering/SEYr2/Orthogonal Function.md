- Extension of concept of [[The Dot Product]] between 2 vectors to the inner product of 2 functions
$$ (f_1, f_2)\triangleq\int_a^bf_1(x)f_2(x) $$
- for $f_1, f_2$ piecewise continuous over \[a,b]
- Inner product must be defined over some interval \[a,b]
- \[a,b] could be ($-\infty, +\infty$), (0,$+\infty$), etc.
- Two vectors were orthogonal if their dot product was zero
- We define two functions to be orthogonal over some interval if their inner product is zero
$$ (f_1, f_2) = \int_a^bf_1(x)f_2(x)dx = 0 $$
- for $f_1, f_2$ orthogonal over \[a,b]
- But
