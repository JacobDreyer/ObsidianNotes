## Relationships
#### Associations Between Variables
- two variables measured on the same cases are associated if knowing the value of one of the variables tells you something you would not know otherwise about the value of another variable
- When examining the relationship between two variables, a new question becomes important:
	- Is your purpose to explore the nature of the relationship,     or
	- do you wish to show that one of the variables can explain variation in the other

- A [[Response Variable]] meassures the outcome of a study. An explanatory variable explains, or causes, changes in the response variable
