The purpose of a [[Sample]] is to give us information about a larger population.

#### Why Should we Rely on Random Sampling?
1. Random Sampling eliminates [[Bias]] in selecting samples from the list of availible individuals
2. The laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about the population
	1. results from random samples come with a margin of error that sets bounds on the size of the likely error
	2. Larger random samples give better information about the population than smaller samples
