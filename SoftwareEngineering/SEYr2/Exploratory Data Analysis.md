## Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Exploring Data
- Begin by examining each variable by itself. Then, move onto study the realtionships among the variables
- Begin with a graph(s). Then add numerical summaries of specific aspects of the data

#### [[Examining Distributions]]
- In any graph look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern
- You can describe the overall pattern by its shape, centre, and spread
- An important kind of deviation is an outlier, an individual that falls outside the overall pattern
- A distribution is symmetric if the right and left sides of the graph are approximately mirror images.
- Right skewed - larger values to the right
- Left skewed - larger values to left
