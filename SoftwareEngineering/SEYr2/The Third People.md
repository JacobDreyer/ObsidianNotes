[[Clifford Sifton]] ([[Minister of the Interior]]) was assigned the task of settling the prarie region of Western Canada

The federal government specifically looked to attract immigrants from [[Scandinavia]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]].

These locations have a similar climate and landscape to the prarie region of Western Canada.

From 1901 to 1921 the population of Western Canada grew from 400,000 to 2 million

A new dimension was therefore added to Canada's population: people with neither a French nor British background

The majority of these new immigrants lived in homesteads. -no electricity, plumbing, shelter

The impact on the landscape in the praries was enormous.

This area has previously been occupied by semi-nomadic Indigenous groups who hunted Buffalo
