## Residuals
- a [[Regression Line]] describes the overall pattern of a linear relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable
- Deviations from the overall pattern are also important. The vertical distances between the points and the [[Least-Squares Regression]] line are called residuals
```ad-tldr
title: Definition:     residual
the difference between an observed value and the value predicted by the regression line
```
residual = observed y - predicted y = $y-\bar y$

#### Residual Plots
- A scatter plot of the regression residuals against the explanatory variable
	- helps assess the fit of a regression line
	- Ideally there should be a random scatter around zero
	- Residual Patterns suggest deviations from a linear relationship
