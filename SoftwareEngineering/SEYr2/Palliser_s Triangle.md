This dry area in the western praries was named by John Palliser, the leader of a land survey expedition of the western part of British North America for Britain in the 1850s

He declared that it was an area unsuitable for agriculture

Since then, growing wheat and cattle ranching have become the common land uses

Farmers here often require government subsidies to aid in suviving long drought conditions
