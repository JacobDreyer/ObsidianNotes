The demand for lumber has been decreasing due to technology lowering the demand for paper
- Websites are replacing newspapers and magazines
- Billing, Accounting, and Banking transactions are all using less paper

[[Softwood Lumber]] is the main export

Most of the land in [[Northern Ontario]] is [[Crown Land]] (it is owned by the provincial government)

Pulp and Paper mills provide many jobs in several small towns throughout this region

The provincial government signs contracts with logging companies where strict regulations are in place such as the [[Annual Allowable Cut]] ([[AAC]])

A challenge in the forestry industry is to maintain a balance between cutting and the regrowth of the forest

Logging companies are responsible for replanting trees as part of their contract
