This was a clash in 1869 along the [[The Red River]] between the federal government and the [[Metis]] who were led by [[Louis Riel]].

The survey system that the federal government developed to organize land in the West ignored existing Metis landholdings

The metis feared for their rights to the land and their place in the new society

The rebellion began when Louis Riel placed his foot on a land surveyor's chain and told the surveyors to leave.

The metis took control of the HBC headquarters.

They then formed a provisional government to negotiate the terms to join Canada as a province.

### Results:
[[Manitoba]] became a small province on July 15, 1870. [[Louis Riel]] is now known as the Father of Manitoba.

In their negotiations with the federal government, the Metis obtained their major demands:
- The use of English and French within the new provincial government
- A dual system of [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] schools
