## Nested Class
[[Class]]

#### Syntax:
```java
class Java_Outer_Class {
	class Java_Inner_Class{
	}
}
```

#### Advantages:
- Can access all members of the outer class. Even private
- Used to develop more readable and maintainable code
	- because it logically groups classes and interfaces in 1 place
- Requires less code to write
- Allows a class definition to be nested inside the definition of another class
- Used when defining a class that is strongly affiliated with another class
