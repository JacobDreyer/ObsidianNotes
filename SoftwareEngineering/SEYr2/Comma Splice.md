A comma splice is the second type of most-common sentence boundary error. A comma splice is when you try to join or splice together two independent/complete thoughts without an appropriate conjunction or joining word.

Effectively, think of the comma as too weak to hold or splice together two independent or complete clauses

Example: I completed my manuscript, I have not submitted it.

Note that these two clauses can be punctuated into two seperate sentences.
