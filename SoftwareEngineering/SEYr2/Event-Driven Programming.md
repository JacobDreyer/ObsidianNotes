- Programs that operate in a GUI enviroment must be event-driven
- An event is an action that takes place within a program such as the clicking of a button
- Part of writing a GUI application is creating [[Event Listeners]]
- An event listener is a method that automatically executs when a specific event occurs
- When an event takes place, the control that is responsible for the event, creates an event object in memory
- The [[Event Object]] contains information about the event
- The control that generated the event object is known as the [[Event Source]]
- It is possible that the event source is connected to one or more event listeners
