If $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_t$ are a partition of set X and $x_i$ has $n_i$ elements then X has 
$n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t$ elements

So the total number of possible outcomes for two or more ==independent events== is the sum of the number of possible outcomes for each event.

For example How many 8-bit strings begin with 000 or 111:

$$ 000\; 22222 $$
$$ 111\; 22222 $$
The twos above represent 2 options for that location
So there is $2^5$ different numbers that start with 000 and $2^5$ different number that start with 111.

So the total combinations is $2^5 + 2^5$
