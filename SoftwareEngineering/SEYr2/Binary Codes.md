## Binary Codes
- any discrete element of information can be represented with a binary code (a pattern of 0s and 1s)
- An n-bit binary code is a group of b bits that has up to $2^n$ distinct combinations of 1s and 0s
- Each element must be assigned a unique bit combination
	- no two elements can have the same value
- The minimum number of bits required to code M distinct quantities is $\log_2M$
- For Example:
	- M = 10 decimal digits can be coded with the minimum 4 bits
- There is no maximum number of bits 

#### Binary Coded Decimal
each digit of the decimal is represented by a 4 bit binary number.

Ex:
27 -> 0010 0111
34 -> 0011 0100

##### Addition
