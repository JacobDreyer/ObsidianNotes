The nul hypothesis $H_0$ (see [[Stating Hypotheses]]) states the claim we seek to disprove

The [[Probability]] that measures the strength of the evidence against a null hypothesis is called a P-value

The probability, computed assuming $H_0$ is true, that the statistic would take a value as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed is called the P-value of the test

==The smaller the P-Value the stronger the evidence against $H_0$==
This is because the P-value says that the observed result is unlikely to happen when $H_0$ is true

There is no ironclad rule for how small a [[P-Value]] should be in order for us to reject $H_0$ 

However we can compare the P-Value with a fixed value that we regard as decisive called the ==significance level== $\alpha$
When our P-Value is less than the chosen $\alpha$, we say that the result is ==statistically significant==.

#### More about P-Values
- Reporting the P-value is a better way to summarize a test than simply stating whether $H_0$ was rejected
