The significance level $\alpha$ of any fixed level test is the probability of a Type I Error (see [[Tests of Significance]])
- The probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis (see [[Stating Hypotheses]]) when its true

So it seems that we should choose a significance level $\alpha$ based on trying to balance and reduce chance of both Type I and Type II errors
