- A number of quotes about it on slide 18
- picture on slide 19 maybe add?
- Why should we solve it? (21)

A note on the 3x+1 conjecture[J. Llibre](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Llibre%2C+J), [C. Valls](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Valls%2C+C)

The 3x+1 conjecture is a simple problem with only 2 rules; pick any number and if the number is even; divide by 2; if the number is odd; increase by ![](file:///C:/Users/jacob/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png). It’s a seemingly simple problem that has absorbed the time of many mathematicians with no one able to determine a proof. Terry Tao has said that "It is also one of the most “dangerous” conjectures known – notorious for absorbing massive amounts of time from both professional and amateur mathematicians."
