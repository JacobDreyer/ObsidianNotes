- Uses a Second [[Hash Function]]
	- Different from the first
	- Depends on the search key
	- Returns non-zero value
- Resolves collision by examining locations
	- At Original Hash index
	- Plus an increment determined by $2^{nd}$ function which is dependent on the search key
		- 1 for [[Linear Probing]]
		- $j^2$ for [[Quadratic Probing]]
- Reaches Every location in the hash table if table size is a prime number
- Avoids both [[Primary Clustering]] and [[Secondary Clustering]]
- Common Choice of [[Compression Function]]:
	- $h_2(key) = q-key\mod q$
	- where q < n
	- q is a prime number
