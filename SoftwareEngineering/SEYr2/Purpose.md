Broad distinction: exposition(writing that aims to inform, explain, explore, express, describe) vs argument (writing that aims to persuade, motivate action)

Aims are rarely mutually exclusive

In [[Engineering Communication]] the aim of persausive writing is usually to motivate action (ie: proposal or reccomendation - think: implementation)

Note also: "Forensic Purpose" docs: post-mortem reports re. design/implementation failure (evaluative)
