#### Establishing Causation
We can evaluate association using the following criteria:
- The Association is strong
- The association is consistent
- Higher doses are associated with stronger responses
- The alleged cause precedes the effect
- The alleged cause is plausible

A properly conducted experiment may establish causation.

Other things to consider when we cannot do an experiment:
- The Association is strong
- The association is consistent
- Higher doses are associated with stronger responses
- The alleged cause precedes the effect
- The alleged cause is plausible
