Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship between cause and effect

linear property is a combination of both [[scaling]] and [[additivity]]

for example, in a resistor $v = iR$. Therefore if i is multiplied by k, v is also multiplied by k

The additivity preoperty requires that 
$$ v_1 = i_1 R\qquad v_2 = i_2 R $$
if the input is $i_1 + i_2$ then the output is $v_1 + v_2 = v$
