$$ v_o = (1 + \frac{R_f}{R_1})v_i $$
Voltage Gain:
$$ A_v = (1+\frac {R_f}{R_1}) = \frac{v_o}{v_i} $$
- a non-inverting amplifier is an op amp circuit designed to provide a positive voltage gain
- Notice that if $R_f = 0$ (Short circuit) or $R_1 = \infty$ (open circuit) or both, the gain become equal to 1
- Under these conditions the circuit becomes what is known as the [[voltage follower]] or [[Unity Gain Amplifier]]
- In Voltage follower:
$$ v_o = v_i $$
- voltage followers are used to isolate one circuit from another
- the voltage follower minimizes interaction between the 2 stages and eliminates interstage loading as shown below
