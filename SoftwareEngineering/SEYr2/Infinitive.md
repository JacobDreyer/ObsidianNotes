The infinitive or 'to' form is when you take any verb and place 'to' in front of it

To shop, to drink, to fly, to write, etc

Infinitives can function as either a [[modifier]] or a [[Noun]]

An infinitive acts as a noun if it acts as a subject

It acts as a modifier if it answers the question why?
