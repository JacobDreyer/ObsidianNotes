- We can, as we have seen with the [[Fourier Integrals]], transform some $f(x)$ into another function of another variable $F(\alpha)$ by an "Integral transformation"
$$ F(\alpha) = \int_a^bf(x)k(\alpha, x)dx $$
- We can recover back f(x) from $F(\alpha)$ by another integral transform
$$ f(x) = \int_c^dF(\alpha)H(\alpha, x)dx $$
- Called the "Inverse transform"
