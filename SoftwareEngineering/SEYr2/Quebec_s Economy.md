The geographic aspects of the economy are like those of [[Ontario's Economy]] since the province can be divided into two economic areas:
- A highly populated [[Core]] ([[Southern Quebec]])
- A resource-based [[Periphery]] ([[Northern Quebec]])

Differences compared to [[Ontario]]:
- The [[Growing Season]] in [[Quebec]] is relatively short this limiting [[Agriculture]]
- [[Quebec]] has much better natural conditions for [[Hydroelectricty]] development

[[Manufacturing]] in [[Quebec]] has declined but remains viable

Today, aircraft and aircraft parts produced by the [[Bombardier]] company are Quebec's leading export

[[Bombardier]] also produces [[passenger trains]], [[Subway]]s, [[Streetcar]]s, [[All-Terrain Vehicle]]s, and [[Snowmobile]]s

The [[Quaternary Sector]] is growing with the provincial government investing heavily in research and development at universities in [[Montreal]]
