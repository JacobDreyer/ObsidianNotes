The distinct culture derives from the historical experience of [[Francophone]]s living in the area for over 400 years

The terms [[Quebecois]] and [[Quebecers]] have both evolved to refer to any resident of [[Quebec]] regardless of mother tongue

Non-Francophone residents tend to be clustered in specific parts of the province

Currently, 78% of the population in [[Quebec]] has [[French]] as their mother tongue.

[[Anglophone]]s and [[allophone]]s tend to be concentrated in [[Montreal]] and [[Gatineau]] (across the river from [[Ottawa]])

Most [[Indigenous People]]s in the province live in [[Northern Quebec]]. [[Cree]] and [[Inuit]] form the majority of this population
