A Mealy-type [[Finite State Machine]] depends both on the current state and the inputs

Generally a Mealy FSM has fewer states than a [[Moore FSM]]

Because a Mealy-FSM depends on input there is the chance that it could change Asynchronously.

The System: $M = (Q,\sum,\Delta,s_0,\delta,\omega)$ defines a [[Mealy FSM]]
See [[Acceptor]] for what each is
