#### To Canada
Canada's population is more multicultural than that of many countries

Most common location where immigrants orginated:
- Early [[1800s]]: [[Britain]]
- [[1840s]]: [[Ireland]]
- Early [[1900s]]: [[Eastern Europe]]
- Since [[1960s]]: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Middle East]]

Why does the federal government encourage immigration:
1. It has become necessary to keep the population growing
2. Newcomers add to [[Canada]]'s workforce
	- Canada like to target immigrant who will add to the workforce
3. Canada accepts refugees who are fleeing oppressive conditions in their homelands
4. Some immigrants are more willing to do seasonal jobs

Immigration currently represents nearly 70% of Canada's Population growth.

Today, 25% of Canada's population is identified as [[allophone]]

Allophone: a person whose mother tounge is not [[French]], [[English]], or an [[Indigenous Language]]

in 2030 annual deaths are expected to outnumber annual births in Canada

From that point forward, immigration would be the only population growth factor

Of Canada's population 24% were born outside the country

A concentration of immigrants in the largest cities makes these areas culturally different than the rest of Canada

### Regional Patterns of Immigration
Of all immigrants, 57% settle in either [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], or [[Vancouver]] [[CMA]]s

The pattern of immigration in Canada has taken on a noticeable [[urban]]/[[rural]] dichtomy

Proposals have been developed to encourage immigrants to settle elsewhere in the country, but none have been passed as policy
