## Stability of a Sorting Algorithm
![[Stability of a Sorting Algorithm]]

## Different Sorting Algorithms
#### Simple Sorting Algorithms
- Easier to understand and implement but are generally slower
- [[Bubble Sort]] (unstable)
- [[Insertion Sort]] (Stable)
- [[Selection Sort]] (unstable, can be made stable)
- [[Shell Sort]] (unstable)

#### Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- Faster than Simple. Good for large data-sets
- [[Merge Sort]] (Stable)
- [[Quick Sort]] (Unstable; Can be made stable using a stable [[Partition Algorithm]])
- [[Radix Sort]] / [[Bucket Sort]] (unstable)
- [[Heap Sort]] (unstable)
