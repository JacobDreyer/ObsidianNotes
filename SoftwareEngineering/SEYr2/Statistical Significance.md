The final step in performing [[Tests of Significance]] is to draw a conclusion about the competing claims you were testing

We will make one of two decisions based on the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis (see [[Stating Hypotheses]]):
- reject $H_0$
- fail to reject $H_0$

If our sample result is too unlikely to have happened by chance assuming $H_0$ is true, then we will reject $H_0$. Otherwise, we fail to reject it

Note:
A fail-to-reject-$H_0$  

There is no ironclad rule for how small a [[P-Value]] should be in order for us to reject $H_0$ 

However we can compare the P-Value with a fixed value that we regard as decisive called the ==significance level== $\alpha$
When our P-Value is less than the chosen $\alpha$, we say that the result is ==statistically significant==.
