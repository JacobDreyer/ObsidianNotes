The probability we assign to an event can change if we know that some other event has ocurred. 

The probability that one event happens given that another event is already known to have happened is called a conditional property

When P(A) > 0 the probability that event B happens given that event A has happened is found by 
$$ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A\; and\; B)}{P(A)} $$
