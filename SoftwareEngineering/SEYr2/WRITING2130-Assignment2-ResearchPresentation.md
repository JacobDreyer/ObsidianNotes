### Description:
- 5-6 minute (voice only) research presentation
- 5-7 Slides

### Key Ideas to Address:

### Important Things:
- Focus of your Paper
- Summary of thesis
	- Some sort of argument about the topic
	- ""
- Explanation of why I chose what I did
- Optional:
	- What current researchers in the field have said
	- How their work is helping focus things

### Effective Presentation:
- The presentation should support and complement my speech without being the exclusive focus
- Order:
	- Gain Attention
	- State Purpose
	- Motivate (Why it matters)
	- Establish Credibility
	- Preview main points

### Presentation Ideas:

### Slides:
Slide 1-2:
- Gain Attention
- "as emmisions become ever larger and evermore important it is necessary for us to look towards reducing these emmisions in order to combat climate change. As it stands the energy sector is responsible for 3/4 of global emmisions. So what is there to do about it?" (transistion to "State Purpose")
Slide 2:
- State Purpose
- Summary of Thesis
Slide 3:
- Motivate
Slide 4:
- Establish Credibility
- Why I chose what I did
Slide 5-6:
- State Points
- Slide 5: Renewables Aren't enough
	- 3/4 of emmisions come from energy sector (which is vague but things are electrifying)
	- Renewables don't work sometimes and we don't have advanced enough battery technology
	- Electricity increased 73%
	- we have been incrteasing renewables at record speeds yet its not catching up 
- Slide 6:
	- Some of the lowest carbon producing countries use nuclear power
	- Nuclear power is developing to include unique solutions/designs
	- France:
		- 10% fossil
		- 67% Nuclear
		- 12% hydro
		- 11% renewables
	- Sweden:
		- 30% Nuclear
		- 45% Hydro
		- 23% Renewables
Slide 7:
- Conclude

#### Potential Points to Bring up:
- Energy sector is responsible for 3/4 of emmisions
