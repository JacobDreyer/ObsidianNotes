A test [[Statistic]] calculated from the [[Sample]] data measures how far the data diverges from what we would expect if the null hypothesis $H_0$ (see [[Stating Hypotheses]]) were true

$$ z = \frac{estimate-hypothesized\; value}{standard\; deviation\; of\; the\; estimate} $$
Large values of the statistic show that the data are not consistent with $H_0$
