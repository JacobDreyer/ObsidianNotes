#### [[Mean]] of the [[Sampling Distribution]] of a [[Sample Mean]]
There is no tendency for a sample mean to fall systematically above or below [[mean]] $\mu$, even if the distribution of the raw data is skewed.

Thus the mean of the sampling distribution is an unbiased estimate of the population mean $\mu$

#### [[Standard Deviation]] of the [[Sampling Distribution of a Sample Mean]]
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution measures how much the sample [[Statistic]] varies from sample to sample

It is smaller than the standard deviation of the population by a factor of $\sqrt n$

Averages are less variable than individual observations
