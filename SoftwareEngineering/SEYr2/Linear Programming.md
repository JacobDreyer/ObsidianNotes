- Informally determines the way to acheive the best outcome in a given mathematical model
- Specific inequalities involving the inputs are found and then an attempt is made to maximize (or minimize) some linear function of the inputs
- You can use linear programming only if there is a linear relationshipbetween the variables you're looking at
- Linear Programming is a mathematical technique ([[Linear Algebra]]) that determines the best way to use availible resources
