- Using Coal plants to build nuclear power plants
	- existing power grid connections
	- avoid land aquisition
	- existing water source
	- rail and road connected
	- people already trained
- Their capacity would be similar to that of the coal plant
- supply chains are similar
- coal provides more than one third of the worldâ€™s electricity
