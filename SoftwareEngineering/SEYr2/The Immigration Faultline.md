Immigration has historially been used as an instrument of colonial power. 

After the british conquest of New France in 1759, the british government set the Immigration policy.

Their objective was to offset the French speaking population by encouraging large scale immigration to British North America (Canada).

After [[Confederation]], Canada remained closely tied to the British Empire.

Immigration policies in the late 1800s continued to reflect the imperialist attitude that British people were superior to people from other countries.

Immigrants from other areas were still needed due to a shortage of workers; the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through the [[Cordillera]] was largely built by 15,000 chinese labourers.

During the late 1800s and early 1900s, new immigrants were still expected to conform to Canadian society. The result was a poor experience for the original farmers of the [[Prairie Provinces]] who were not of British descent.
