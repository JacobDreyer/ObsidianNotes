The colon is almost always used to join two unequal but conceptually related elements in which there is a main/independent clause to the left and a fragmentary element after the colon on the right

Colons generally follow independent clauses. As a rule, they must follow a complete thought. They are also used to introduce lists, examples, and long or formal quotations.

The colon functions to introduce a looking forward or sense of anticipation in writing - a "herald of information to come"

Whereas a semi-colon halts, interuppts, introduces a pause for reflection, a colon leads more to what follows, showing relation and emphasis. The colon creates emphasis on the ideas that follow them and clarifies what precedes it.

We emply colons if the second part amplifies, explains, or summarizes the first

#### Colon Mistakes
