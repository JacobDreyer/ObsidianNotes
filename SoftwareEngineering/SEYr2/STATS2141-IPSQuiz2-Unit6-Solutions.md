##### Question 1
The attention span of children (ages 3 to 5) is claimed to be Normally distributed with a mean of 15 minutes and a ==standard deviation of 4 minutes.== A test is to be performed to decide whether the average attention span of these kids is really this short or is actually longer. You decide to test the hypotheses $H_0: \mu = 15$ versus $H_a: \mu > 15$ at the ==5% significance level==. A sample of ==10 children== will watch a TV show they have never seen before, and the time until they walk away from the show will be recorded. If, in fact, the true mean attention span of these kids is 18 minutes, what is the probability of a Type II error?
- [ ] 0.0107
- [x] .2335
- [ ] .3405
- [ ] .7665

$$ P(Type \; I \; Error) = 5\% $$
2.5% = Probability of Type I error in right quadrant
$$ 0.05 = P(z < -c) $$
$$ = P(z < 1.64) $$
$z\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n} +\mu =x$ 
$$ P(Type\; II\; Error) = P(\bar x < 17.07) $$
$$ P(Type\; II\; Error) = P(z < -.735) $$
$$ = .2296 = 23.0\% $$
##### Question 2
Suppose a study was done to determine whether the average amount of sleep that students get the night before an exam is less than 6 hours. An SRS of 100 students from a university was taken, and a mean of 5.5 hours was computed from the sample. The figure below provides the results of the analysis.
![[Pasted image 20221109205543.png]]
What is your conclusion based on the results of this study? (Assume a significance level of 0.05.)
- [x] On average, students typically get less than 6 hours of sleep the night before an exam.
- [ ] On average, students typically get 6 hours of sleep the night before an exam
- [ ] On average, students typically get more than 6 hours of sleep the night before an exam.
- [ ] On average, students typically get 5.5 hours of sleep the night before an exam.

P-Value < $\alpha$ so we reject null hypothesis

##### Question 3
A researcher plans to conduct a test of hypotheses at the 1% significance level. She designs her study to have a power of 0.90 at a particular alternative value of the parameter of interest. What is the probability that the researcher will commit a Type II error for the particular alternative value of the parameter at which she computed the power?
- [ ] .01
- [x] .1
- [ ] .9
- [ ] .99

P(Type II Error) = 1 - power

##### Question 4
In order to obtain a small margin of error with high levels of confidence, C, you will need \_\_\_\_\_\_ observations.
- [x] a large number of
- [ ] a small number
- [ ] 10
- [ ] none of the above

$$ m = z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}\qquad z^*\uparrow\; when\; C\uparrow $$
##### Question 5
An agronomist has conducted a study on the cellulose content of a variety of alfalfa hay. Knowing that $\sigma = 8$ mg/g, and having the sample results from 15 cuttings for which $\bar x =$ 145 mg/g, the agronomist constructed a ==90% confidence interval== estimate of $\mu$ and he also ==tested the hypotheses== $H_0: \mu = 140 mg/g$ versus $H_a: \mu > 140$ mg/g. For these two procedures to be valid, what assumption(s) must be made?
- [ ] The 15 sample cuttings are a simple random sample.
- [ ] The cellulose content variable is Normally distributed or at least not extremely non-Normal.
- [ ] The experiment conducted to get these data involved a randomized comparison.
- [x] Statements A and B must both be assumed
- [ ] Statements A, B, and C must all be assumed.

##### Question 6
An agricultural researcher plants 25 plots with a new variety of yellow corn. Assume that the yield per acre for the new variety of yellow corn follows a Normal distribution with an unknown mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 10$ bushels per acre. If the average yield for these 25 plots is $\bar x = 150$ bushels per acre, what is a 90% confidence interval for $\mu$
- [ ] $150 \pm .784$
- [ ] $150 \pm2.00$
- [x] $150 \pm3.29$
- [ ] $150 \pm3.92$
$$ estimate\pm margin\; of\; error $$
$$ 150\pm z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n} $$
$$ 150 \pm 1.645\frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} $$
$$ 150\pm 3.29 $$
##### Question 7
The purpose of forming confidence intervals is to find the exact value of the true population mean based on a random sample.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

A confidence Interval is just an interval of possible values

##### Question 8
The results obtained from a test of significance can always be trusted as long as the data collection methods are correct.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

There is always the chance for Type I or Type II Errors

##### Question 9
The time needed for college students to complete a certain paper-and-pencil maze follows a Normal distribution with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of 3 seconds. You wish to see whether the mean time $\mu$ is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a group of nine college students exercise vigorously for 30 minutes and then complete the maze. Assume that $\sigma$ remains unchanged at 3 seconds. The hypotheses you decide to test are $H_0: \mu = 30$ versus $H_a: \mu \neq 30$ Suppose you compute the average time that it takes these students to complete the maze, and you find that the results are significant at the 5% level. What can you conclude?
- [x] The test would also be significant at the 10% level.
- [ ] The test would also be significant at the 1% level.
- [ ] Both of the above
- [ ] None of the above

$$ PValue < .05 < .1 $$
However just because PValue < .05 does not mean PValue < .01

If results are Significant: Pvalue < $\alpha$

##### Question 10
The actual arrival time of the commuter bus at the final bus stop as compared to the scheduled arrival time is known to be Normally distributed with a mean of 1 minute and a standard deviation of 3 minutes (a negative value meaning the bus arrived early, a positive value meaning the bus arrived late). You ride the bus frequently and are under the impression that the mean arrival time is much later than the commuter bus service claims. You decide to test the hypotheses $H_0: \mu = 1\; versus\; H_a: \mu>1$ You take a simple random sample of 10 trips and record the differences between the actual arrival time and the scheduled arrival time. You decide to reject H0 if x > 3 If, in fact, the true mean is 2 minutes, what is the probability of a Type II error?
- [ ] .1459
- [x] .8541
- [ ] .95
- [ ] .9825
![[Drawing 2022-11-09 21.39.59.excalidraw]]
$$ P(Type\; II\; Error) = P(x < 3) $$
$$ = P(z < \frac1{\sqrt{10}}) = P(z < 1.05) $$
$$ = .8531 $$
