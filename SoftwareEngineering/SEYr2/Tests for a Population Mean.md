Draw an SRS of size n from a Normal Population that has unknown [[mean]] $\mu$ and known [[Standard Deviation]] $\sigma$. To test the null hypothesis (see [[Stating Hypotheses]])
$$ H_0:\mu = \mu_0 $$
that $\mu$ has the, we calculate the one-sample z statistic
$$ z = \frac{\bar x-\mu_0}{\sigma/
\sqrt n} $$
