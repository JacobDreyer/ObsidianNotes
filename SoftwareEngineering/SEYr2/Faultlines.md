Fault lines are metaphors applied to economic, social, and political 'cracks' that divide regions and threaten to destabilize Canada's integrity as a nation.

There are four faultlines that have played a role in Canada's historic evolution and have had profound regional consequences

### The 4 Faultlines in Canada:
##### 1. [[Centralist vs Decentralist Faultline]]
This faultline relates Canada's political system and refers to the centralization of government power (federal power) versus the decentralization of power (provincial power)

Demography favours Ontario and Quebec because the majority of Canadians reside in these areas

Previous governments led by Stephen Harper saw the growth of the energy sector as being in the national interest.

This dramatic shift in philosophy toward energy has resulted in disputes between some provinces and the federal government.

##### 2. [[The French - English Faultline]]
French is the only official language in Quebec but there is a political and cultural struggle to maintain French as a viable language within a primarialy English-Speaking continent

##### 3. [[Indigenous Peoples and the Non-Indigenous Faultline]]
There are 3 groups of Indigenous Peoples in Canada: First Nations, Metis, and Inuit

A higher proportion of Indigenous communitites remain dependent on the federal government relative to other communities

Indigenous residential schools of the past were designed to assimilate youth and to discourage the use of indigenous languages.

Treaties and land claim agreements have led to Indigenous self-government on reserves

##### 4. [[The Immigration Faultline]]
Many new immigrants are concentrated in major cities: this gives them a network of family and friends who speak their language and restaurants that serve their desired food. However, this may create a sense of isolation from other Canadians, particularily those living in small towns or rural areas.
