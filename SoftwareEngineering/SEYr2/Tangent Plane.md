A direct consequence of the observation that $\nabla F$ is perpindicular to the [[Level Surface]] of F at a point P, is opportunity to define a tangent plane to a [[Level Surface]]

$P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on $F(x,y,z)=c$ where $\nabla F\neq 0$. The tangent plane at P is the plane through P that is normal to $\nabla F$ at P

###### Equation for tangent plane at P
$$ \frac{\partial }{\partial x}F(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial }{\partial y}F(x_0, y_0, z_0)(y-y_0)+\frac{\partial }{\partial z}F(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z-z_0)=0 $$
