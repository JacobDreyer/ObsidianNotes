Suppose we have a two-terminal circuit represented by Thevenin's equivalent circuit and we connect a load resistance $R_L$
![[Pasted image 20230226151253.png]]
When $R_L = R_t$, maximum power is absorbed by the load resistance $R_L$

The current through the load resistance is:
$$ i_L = \frac{V_t}{R_t + R_L} $$
and power is therfore given by:
$$ p_L = i_L^2R_L = (\frac{V_t}{R_t + R_L})^2R_L $$
What value of $R_L$ delivers the most power
