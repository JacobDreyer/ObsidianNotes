[[Megaprojects]] are resource development projects that are controlled by large multinational corporations

They often have capital costs of more than $1 billion and require several years to contruct

Since all megaprojects in [[The Territorial North]] are based on [[non-renewable resource]]s, the projects have a limited lifespan

Examples:
- [[The Mackenzie Gas Project]]
- [[The Norman Wells Oil Field]]
- [[The Northwest Territories Diamond Project]]

While megaprojects create development, they are not necessarily beneficial to [[The Territorial North]]

Why?
- The construction equipment and supplies are manufactured outside the region
- They have negative impact on the landscape
- Many workers live in provinces and spend their wages in their home communities 
- Workers from the provinces pay income tax to provincial rather then territorial governments
