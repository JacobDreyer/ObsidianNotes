Early exploration of the land was by [[Spanish Explorers]], [[Russian Explorers]], and [[British Explorers]]. [[Spain]] eventually surrendered its claim to the [[Pacific Coast]]al areas north of $42^o$N [[Latitude]].

The [[US]]-[[British]] boundary was drawn along the $49^o$N latitude in [[1846]]

This line of latitide then became the [[US-Canada Border]] from the [[BC]] coast to [[Lake of the Woods]] in [[Northern Ontario]]

In the mid [[1800s]] there was an influx of Americans to the area during gold rushes

[[Britain]] established the colony of [[British Columbia]] in [[1858]] to ensure british rule over the land

After [[Confederation]], the federal government aimed to lure [[BC]] into [[Canada]] by promising to build a railroad to the [[pacific ocean]] within 10 years of [[BC]] joining

[[BC]] became the 6th canadian province in [[1871]]

After completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], towns and cities developed along that corridor.

[[Vancouver]] quickly grew as a [[Trans-Shipment Point]] for [[Lumber]] and [[Coal]] from [[BC]] and for [[Grain]] grown in the [[Praries]]

[[The 2010 Winter Olympics]] placed [[BC]] on the world stage and is a high point in its history
