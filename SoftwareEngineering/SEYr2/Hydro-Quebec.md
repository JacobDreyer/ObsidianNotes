[[Hydro-Quebec]] is a sense of pride among [[Quebec]] residents and has become a symbol of the economic prominence of the province.

It was created in [[1944]] but remained a minor force until Premier [[Jen Lesage]] came to power in [[1960]]

At that time, [[Quebec]] announced it would purchase all private electrical utilities in the province

This created a monopoly to generate and distribute electricity both within the province and for export

### Objectives of Hydro-Quebec
- Stimulate economic growth through government intervention
- Undertake construction of massive [[Hydroelectricty]] projects in the [[Canadian Shield]]
- Biuld [[High Voltage Transmission Lines]] to transport electricity
- Sell Power to northeastern states in the [[US]]

These strategies have been highly successfull

The massive revenue generated by Hydro-Quebec played a role in fueling [[The Quiet Revolution]] which led to the spread of separatist views

### Possible Expantions of Hydro-Quebec
Aquiring the electrical utilities in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] is a long-term goal

The strategy is to gain control of the power grid in these provinces to acheive complete dominance of energy in the area along with a share of the market in [[New York State]] and the 6 [[New England States]]

### [[Hydroelectricty]]
![[Hydroelectricty]]

[[Precipitation]] is abundant in [[Quebec]]. This supports large, high-volume rivers.

Variable [[Topography]] with entrenched river valleys and canyons ensure a steady flow of water for the power plants

[[High Voltage Transmission Lines]] connect the plants in the north to the populated markets in the south

### Attracting Large-Scale Industry
Hydro-Quebec has indirectly impoved [[Quebec's Economy]] by attracting large scale industrial development

Hydro-Quebec can offer energy to these industrial firms at a greatly discounted cost

##### Energy Prices for Industry
How is Hydro-Quebec able to offer low energy prices to industrial firms?
1. [[Northern Quebec]] can produce vast amounts of energy (Much more than the province needs)
2. Hydro-Quebec has a lon-term contract to buy power from [[Churchill Falls]] in [[Labrador]] at [[1969]] prices
3. When selling power, Hydro Quebec is free to set its own sale price without the concern of competition
