title: Definition

A relation R on a set X is a subset of X $\times$ X.
if (a,b) $\in$ R, we write xRy

"x is related to y"
```

#### [[Reflexive Relation]]
$\forall x\quad xRx$
x is related to x for all x

For example an equals relationship
For some element 4 in X then (4,4) will always be in R because 4=4

#### [[Symmetric Relation]]
$\forall x\forall y \quad xRy\quad yRx$

#### [[Transitive Relation]]
$\forall x\forall y\forall z \quad xRy\land yRz\to xRz$

#### [[Equivalence Relations]]
A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

If R is an equivalence Relation and (a,b) $\in$ R write a~b or a ~$_R$ b

Ex. $R = R_n = \{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z: a\equiv b \; mod\; n\}$
Then a~b (a is realted to b) when a,b have the same remainder when divided by n
