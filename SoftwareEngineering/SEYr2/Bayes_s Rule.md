Suppose that a sample space is decomposed into k disjoint events $A_1$, $A_2$, $\cdots$, $A_k$
none of which has a 0 probability - such that P($A_1$) + P($A_2$) + $\cdots$ + P($A_k$) = 1

Let C be any other event such that P(C) $\neq$ 0
Then:
$$ P(A_i|C) = \frac{P(C|A_i)P(A_i)}{P(C|A_1)P(A_1) + P(C|A_2)P(A_2)+\cdots+P(C|A_k)P(A_k)} $$
```ad-note
It is often easier to use a [[Probability Tree]]
