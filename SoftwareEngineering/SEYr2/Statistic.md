title: Definition

A statistic is a number that describes some characteristic of a [[Sample]]
```

- Can be computed directly from the [[Sample]] data, but it can change from sample to sample.
- We often use a statistic to estimate an unknown [[Parameter]]

Remember S and P:                                                           
[[Statistic]]s come from [[Sample]]s                                              
and [[Parameter]]s come from [[Population]]s
