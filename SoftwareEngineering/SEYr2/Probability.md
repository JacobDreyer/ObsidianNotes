### The Language of Probability
Chance behavior is unpredictable in the short run but has a regular and predictable pattern in the long run

A phenomenon is random if individual outcomes are uncertain but there is nonetheless a regular distribution of outcomes in several repetirion

The probabilit of any outcome of a random phenomenon is the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a very long series of repetirion

### Probability Models
Descriptions of chance behavior contain two parts:
- A list of possible outcomes, and
- a probabilty for each outcome

The sample space S of a random phenomenon is the set of all possible outcomes.

an [[Event]] is an outcome or a set of outcomes of a random phenomenon. That, is an event is a subset of the sample space.

A [[Probability Model]] is a description of some random phenomenon that consists of 2 parts: A sample space S and a probability for each outcome

#### Venn Diagrams
Sometimes, it is helpfull to draw a picture to display relations among several events. A picture that shows the sample space S as a rectangular area and events as areas within S is called a Venn Diagram

### Assigning Probability
##### Finite Probability Models
One way to assign probabilities to events is to assign a probability to every individual outcome and then add these probabilities to find the probability of any event

This idea works well when there is only a finite number of outcomes

##### Equally Likely Probabilities
In some circumstances we are willing to assume that individual outcomes are equally likely because of some balance in the phenomenon, such as dice or coins

if a random phenomenon has k outcomes, all equally likely, then each individual outcome has a probability $\frac{1}{k}$. The probability of any event A is 
$$ P(A) = \frac{a}{k} $$
$a$ = count of outcomes in A

### [[Independence]]
If two events A and B do not influence each other, and if knowledge about one does not change the probability of the other, the events are said to be independent of each other

##### The Multiplication Rule for Independent Events
If A and B are independent:
$$ P(A\; and\; B) = P(A)\times P(B) $$
