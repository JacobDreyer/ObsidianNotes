The Table and Equation assume that a clock is used to trigger changes in state

### Characteristic Table
A characteristic table shows the output of a from the next state of a [[Sequential Circuits]] based on the inputs


| D   | Q(t+1) |
| --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0       |
| 1    | 1       |
D = external Input for current clock cycle (instant clock had an rising/falling edge)


### Characteristic Equation
A characteristic equation is an equation giving the next state of a sequential circuit based on the inputs and the current state.

Same as the above table
$$ Q(t+1) = D $$
