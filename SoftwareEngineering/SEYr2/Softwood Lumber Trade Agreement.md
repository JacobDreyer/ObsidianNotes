A 9-year agreement between the [[US]] and [[Canada]] was signed in [[2006]] which put an end to the dispute during that time

Highlights of the Agreement:
- The [[US]] had to return $4 billion of duty that it charged on [[Canadian Lumber Companies]] since [[2002]]
- The [[US]] could not launch any more trade actions against Canadian Lumber Companies
- If lumber prices were below a certain value, [[Canada]] had to impose a tax on its own lumber exports
