Some of the new settlers to the [[Prairie Provinces]] preferred to maintain their own cultural traditions.

Doukhobors were communalists who did not believe in individual land ownership of land or government regulation.

Many of the Doukhobors who moved to Canada had orginially refused to serve in the [[Russian Army]] and were thus persecuted by [[Russia]].

They were granted blocks of land in [[Western Canada]] and freedom from military service.

Doukhobors refused to swear an oath to the King of England.

In 1905, the new [[Minister of the Interior]] [[Frank Oliver]] chose to enforce the [[Dominion Lands Act]] 

This allowed the federal government to cancel the Doukhobors' rights to the land
