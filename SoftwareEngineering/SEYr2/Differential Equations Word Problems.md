[[Differential Equations]]
### Main Types:
- Growth & Decay Problems
- Half Lifes
- [[Newton's Law of Cooling]]
- Mixture Problems
- Basic Circuits

### Growth and Decay
$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = kx,\qquad x(0) = x_0 $$
##### Half-Life
$$ \frac{dA}{dt} = kA,\qquad A(0)=A_0 $$
$t =$ # of half-lives, not time

### Newton's Law of Cooling/Heating
$$ \frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-T_m) $$
- Start Temp, find new Temp
- T = Ambient Temperature
- Tm = Temperature of the item

### Mixing Problem
- Mixing 2 fluids (typically salt-brine to tank of water)
- $\frac{dx}{dt}$ = Input Rate - Output Rate
	 = $R_{in} - R_{out}$
- $R_{in}$ = conc. in $\cdot$ Rate Entering
	  = lbs/min
- $R_{out}$ = conc. out $\cdot$ Rate Leaving
	- conc. out = x/size of tank

### Series Circuit
$$ LR\quad L\frac{di}{dt} + R_i = E(t) $$
$$ RC\quad R\frac{dq}{dt} + \frac1Cq = E(t) $$
- $i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt}$
- $i$ = Current
- $R$ = Resistance
- $E(t)$ = Voltage of Batter
- $C$ = Capacitance
- $q$ = charge
