Another quantity of interest is the apparent power (S) which is defined as the product of rms or effective values of voltage and current, or
$$ S = V_{rms}I_{rms} $$
The relationship between the three powers in ac circuits is given by:
$$ P^2 + Q^2 = S^2 $$
The relationship between P, Q, S and $\theta$ can be represented by [[Power Triangle]]
