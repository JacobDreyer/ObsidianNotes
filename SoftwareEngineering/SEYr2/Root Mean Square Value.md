\- Consider applying a [[Periodic Voltage]] $v(t)$ with period $T$ to a [[Resistance]] $R$
- The power delivered to the resistance is given by:
$$ p(t) = \frac{v^2(t)}{R} $$
- The [[Energy]] delivered in one period is given by:
$$ E_T = \int_0^T p(t)dt $$
- The average power delivered to the resistance is the energy delivered in one cycle divided by the period:
$$ P_{avg} = \frac{E_T}{T} = \frac1T\int_0^Tp(t)dt = \frac1T\int_0^T\frac{v^2(t)}{R}dt $$
$$ P_{avg} = \frac{[\sqrt{\frac1T\int_0^Tv^2(t)dt}]^2}{R} $$
- The root mean square ([[RMS]]) value of a [[Periodic Voltage]] $v(t)$ is:
$$ V_{rms} = [\frac1T\int_0^T v^2(t)dt]^{\frac12} $$
- Using this value the average power delivered is:
$$ P_{avg} = \frac{V_{rms}^2}{R} $$
- Thus, if [[RMS]] value of a periodic voltage is known, it is fairly simple to compute the average power the voltage can deliver
- The root mean square value is also called the [[Effective Value]]
- For periodic current $i(t)$ the average power delivered is:
$$ P_{avg} = I_{rms}^2R $$
- Where
$$ I_{rms} = [\frac1T\int_0^Ti^2(t)dt]^{\frac12} $$
