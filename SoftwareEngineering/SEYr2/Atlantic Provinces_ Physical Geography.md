The area contsists of two [[Physiographic Region]]s:
- The [[Appalachian Uplands]]
- The [[Canadian Shield]]

[[The Maritimes]] and the island of [[Newfoundland]] are located in the [[Appalachian Uplands]]

The [[Appalachian Uplands]] are an ancient, highly eroded mountain chain.

Streams of meltwater from melting glaciers have cut deeply into the land resulting in hilly terrain with rugged areas and fjords

### [[The Tablelands]]
[[The Tablelands]] in [[Western Newfoundland]] is one of the few places in the world where [[Earth's Mantle]] is exposed

the collision of two [[Tectonic Plate]]s 350 million years ago forced the [[Earth's Mantle]] up and over the crust

The rock of the mantle is [[Ultramafic]] and lacks the nutrients required to support plant life

The landscape is barren and desert-like despite receiving a large amount of precipitation

### [[Labrador]]
[[Labrador]] is located in the [[Canadian Shield]]

The most prominent physical features in [[Labrador]] are [[The Torngat Mountains]] in the northern tip; they formed 750 million years ago
