## Digital Systems
- Manipulate discrete values that are represented in binary form
- A binary digit called a bit has 2 values: 0 & 1
- Digital systems consist of digital circuits
- Digital circuits can be designed using logic gates
- Operands used for processing in digital circuitsmay be represented in the binary number system
