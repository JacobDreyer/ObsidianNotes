The industry has been a major, well-paying employer in [[Southern Ontario]] for over 100 years

The first auto plants in [[North America]] were built in [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor]]; the auto industry then expanded throughout the lower [[Great Lakes]] area on both sides of the border

Of all vehicles made in [[North America]] today, 15% are made in [[Southern Ontario]]

The wages recieved by autoworkers help to drive the retail and service sectors of [[Ontario's Economy]]

There are 5 parts to the industry:
- Suppliers of Materials
- Parts production in small factories
- Vehicle Assembly in massive plants
- Service firms (Advertisers, Designers, sales)
- Corporate (decision makers, administration)

[[Just-in-time Principle]]:
A system in which auto parts are delivered at the exact time required by the vehicle assembly plants.

This is used by the Auto Industry to take advantage of savings in inventory and warehousing
