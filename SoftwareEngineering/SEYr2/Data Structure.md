## Data Structure
- Provides organization of mathmatical and logical concepts of data
- arranges data so it can be accessed/manipulated more efficiently

#### Factors for Choosing a Data Structure
- What kind of information will be stored?
- How will that information be used?
- Where should data be kept
- What is the best way to organize the data
- What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be considered?

#### Classification of Data Structures
▪ Linear or non-linear: 
	– The data items are arranged in sequential order (Linear), such as with an array, or in an unordered sequence (non-linear), such as with a graph.
- Homogeneous or heterogeneous: 
	– The data items in a given repository are of the same type (Homogeneous), such as the elements in an array, or of various types (heterogeneous), such as an abstract data type defined as a class specification in Java (discussed later).
▪ Static or dynamic: 
	– This characteristic describes how the data structures are compiled. The static data structures have fixed sizes, structures and memory locations at compile time. The dynamic data structures have sizes, structures and memory locations that can shrink or expand, depending on the use.

#### Linear vs Non-Linear
▪ Linear Data Structure – 
	– In linear data structures, each element is linearly connected to each other having reference to the next and previous elements. 
	– Implementation is quite easy as only a single level is involved. 
	– Wastage of memory is much more common in linear data structures. 
	– Stacks, Queues, Arrays, and Linked lists are all examples of linear data structure
- Non-Linear Data Structure –
	– In non-linear data structures, the elements are connected in a hierarchical manner. 
	– Implementation is much more complex as multiple levels are involved. 
	– Memory is consumed wisely and there is almost no wastage of memory. 
	– Graphs and trees are examples of non-linear data structures.
