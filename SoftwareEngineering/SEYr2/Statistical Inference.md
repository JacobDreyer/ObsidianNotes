The Process of statistical inference involves using information from a [[Sample]] to draw conclusions about a wider [[Population]]

Different random samples yield different [[Statistic]]s. We need to be able to describe the [[Sampling Distribution]] of the possible values of a statistic in order to perform statistical inference

### Overview
Statistical inference involves 2 prominent techniques
1. [[Confidence Interval]]
2. [[Hypothesis Tests]]

In both techniques, we ask:
"What would happen if we used the method many times"

Formal Statistical inference is based on [[Sampling Distribution]]s. so we must understand the language of probability and the logic of the reasoning.

When you see a statistical inference, you should act as if your data came from a [[random sample]] or a randomized experiment

### Simple Conditions for Inference About a [[Mean]]
1. We have a SRS from the population of interest. There is no noresponse or other practical difficulty
2. The variable we measure has [[Normal Distribution]] N($\mu, \sigma$) in the population
3. We do not know the [[Mean]] $\mu$
4. We know the [[Standard Deviation]] $\sigma$

Note:
Conditions 1,2, and 4 are all unrealistic
