What is Genre?
- Form/type of communication - "balancing of form and function"; relying on expectation to help address need

Channel Choice?
- medium of transmission: function of percieved need (purpose) and audience analysis

Genre = anticipating/fulfilling reader expectations re. formal components of documents we write to achieve our purpose. 

Recognizable forms help readers organize and extract needed information efficiently and accurately

Effective communication invlolves balancing two primary concerns of genre: using familiar forms, adapting them according to exigence

When we depart from conventions of genre in problematic ways, it is noticeble and complicates basic task information retreival (understanding - which leads to implementation)

Genre savvy: awareness of demands/expectations of genre (form) most commonly employed in a given rhetorical situation so as to be able to depart from genre tellingly/usefully (per seeming needs of audience/exigency of situation)

New [[Rhetorical Situation]]s necessarily shaped by (and produce) new communication demands; they can beget new ways of documenting - new variations on/transformations of existing genres
