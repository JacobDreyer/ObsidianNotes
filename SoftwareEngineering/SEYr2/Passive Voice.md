### Passive Voice Constructions
- The passive voice pairs helping, or "be" [[Verb]]s such as "be, am, is, are, was, were, being, been" with either the [[past participle]] or the [[Present Participle]]
- Note: Be careful not to confuse passive with past tense

Past:
PV Ex: The dishes were washed by my roommate.
AV Ex: My roommate washed the dishes.

Present:
PV Ex: The engineer is arguing for an improved design before construction begins.
AV Ex: The engineer argues for an improved design before construction begins.

Future:
PV Ex: The quiz will be written online.
AV Ex: Students will write the quiz online.

### How to Change Passive Voice to Active Voice
Identify the [[verb]] (action) and [[subject]] (who is doing the action) of the sentence and then follow this formula:
1. Name the verb's actor as the subject
2. Choose an active verb form (NOT a helping "be" + [[verb]])
3. Turn the old subject into an object

### When is the Passive Voice Useful?
1. When the actor is unknown
2. When the actor is less important than the object of the action
	- Ex. The internet was established in 1969 by the US Department of Defense
3. When we want to aid flow between sentences by putting info at the end of one sentence that leads/introduces what will appear at the begininng of the next sentence

### Passive Voice in Engineering Writing
- In [[Engineering Writing]], because there is often a goal of implementation, the active voice is preferable.
- The active voice requires engineers to take ownership or credit for ideas because the subject  of the sentence is clearly identifiable
- Often in professional or academic writing, it is also appropriate to use the [[First Person]]
