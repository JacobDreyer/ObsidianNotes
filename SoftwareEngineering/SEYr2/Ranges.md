- The range type represents an [[Immutable Sequence]] of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops
- Implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition to avoid violating the generation pattern
```python
range(stop)
range(start, stop[, step])
```
