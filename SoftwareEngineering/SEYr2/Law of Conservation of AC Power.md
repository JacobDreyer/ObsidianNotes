- The principle of conservation of power applies to AC circuits as well as DC circuits
- In general, the power supplied by the source is equal to the total power delivered to the load
- Thus, in general, for a source connected to N loads,
$$ S = S_1 + S_2 + \cdots + S_N $$
- This means that the total [[Complex Power]] in a network is the sum of the complex powers of individual components
