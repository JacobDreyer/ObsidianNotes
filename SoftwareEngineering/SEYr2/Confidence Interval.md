#### The Big Idea:
The [[Sampling Distribution]] of $\bar x$ tells us how close to [[Mean]] $\mu$ the [[Sample Mean]] $\bar x$ is likely to be.

A Level C confidence interval for a [[Parameter]] has two parts:
- An interval calculated from the data, which has the form
$$  estimate\pm margin\; of\; error  $$
- ==This means that the confidence interval is 2m== (m=margin of error)
- A confidence level C, where C is the [[Probability]] that the interval will capture the true [[Parameter]] value in repeated samples. (The Success Rate)

Note: Typically we chose a confidence level above 90% because we want to be sure of our conclusions. The most common is 95%

#### Calculating
Choose an SRS of size n from a population having unknown [[Mean]] $\mu$ and known [[Standard Deviation]] $\sigma$. A level C confidence interval for $\mu$ is
$$ \bar x\pm z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n} $$
The critical value $z^*$ is found from the standard [[Normal Distribution]]. value of $z^*$ corresponds to a [[Confidence Level]] C
