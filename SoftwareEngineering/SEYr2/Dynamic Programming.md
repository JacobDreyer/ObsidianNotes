- Avoids re-computing solutions that have already been computed
- Constructs the optimal solution to a problem from optimal solutions to subproblems
- Main difference between Dynamic Programming an d[[Divide and Conquer Algorithm]]:
	- The subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming.
