The proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] results in a high amount of [[Precipitation]]

The cold [[Labrador Current]] keeps winter temperatures low enough so that most precipitation in winter falls as snow

[[Weather System]]s that move from west to east across [[North America]] gain moisture from the ocean and thus intensify as they move over the region

Systems that rapidly gain intensity in this way are reffered to as [[Nor'easters]]

Though still below freezing, the moderating effect of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] keeps winter temperatures along the coast warmer than other parts of [[Canada]] that are at similar Latitudes

At any time of year, warm air masses that originate over [[The Gulf of Mexico]] can travel up the coast and collide with cold continental air masses, leading to heavy cloud cover.
