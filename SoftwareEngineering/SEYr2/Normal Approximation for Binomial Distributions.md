Suppose that X has the [[Binomial Distribution]] with n trials and success probability p. When n is large, the distribution of X is approximately Normal with [[mean]] and [[Standard Deviation]]
$$ \mu_X = np\qquad\sigma_X = \sqrt{np(1-p)} $$
As a rule of thumb we will use the normal approximation when n is so large that np $\geq$ 10 and $n(1-p)\geq 10$
