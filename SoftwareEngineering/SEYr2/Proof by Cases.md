prove $\phi\lor\psi \to x$
Assume $\phi$
	Show $x$
Assume $\psi$
	Show $x$

Ex. if n is an integer, $n^2 + 3n + 4$ is even
Case 1:
n is odd; n = 2k +1
$$ 4k^2+4k+1+6k+3+8 $$
$$ 4k^2+10k + 12 $$
All terms are divisible by 2 so it is even

Case2:
n is even n = 2k
$$ 4k^2+6k+4 $$
all divisible by 2 so it is even

both are even so it will always be even if n is an integer
