### Might Include:
- [[Partition]]
	- forming equivalence relation from partition
	- form partition with pieces $[a]_R$
- [[Equivalence Class]]
	- $[a]_n = \{b\in Z: a\equiv b\mod n\}$
	- $[0]_n, [1]_n,\cdots,[n-1]_n$
		- These are partitions of $\mathbb Z$
	- $[a]_n + [b]_n = [a+b]_n$
		- same with multiplication
	- Equivalence classes of set A froms partition of A
- [[The Division Algorithm]]
- [[Euclid's Lemma]]
- [[Euclidean Algorithm]]
- [[Order of Vanishing]]
- [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]]
