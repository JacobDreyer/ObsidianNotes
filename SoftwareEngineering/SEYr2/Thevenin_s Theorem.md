a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source $V_t$ in series with a resistor $R_t$
- $V_t$ is the open circuit voltage at the terminals
- $R_t$ is input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off

### Finding Thevenin's Resistance Directly
To find $R_t$ when the circuit contains no dependent sources:
1. Replace all voltage sources by short circuits
2. Replace all current sources by open circuits
3. Find the equivalent resistance of the circuit looking back into the terminals
