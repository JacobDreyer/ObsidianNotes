$$  f(x) = \frac {a_0}2 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty(a_n\cos\frac{n\pi x}p + b_n\sin\frac{n\pi x}p)  $$
- We have already noticed something in some of the examples

1. If f(x) is "even" (i.e. $f(-x)=f(x)$) then the f.s. of $f(x)$ is composed entirely of cosine terms
2. If $f(x)$ is "odd" (i.e. $f(-x) = -f(x)$), then the f.s. of $f(x)$ is composed of entirely sine terms

If the f.s. is purely cosine terms (if even), we sometimes call it a "[[Fourier Cosine Series]]"

Alternatively is the f.s. is only sine terms (if odd) we sometimes refer to it as a "[[Fourier Sine Series]]"
