While [[Adjective]]s modify [[Noun]]s or [[Pronoun]]s, adverbs modify everything else

An adverb can modify a [[Verb]], an [[Adjective]], another adverb, a [[Phrase]], or a [[Clause]]. Adverbs indicate manner, time, place, cause, or degree, and answers, questions such as How? When? Where? Why?

While some adverbs can be identified by their characteristic "ly" suffix, most of them must be identified by untangling the grammatical relationships within the sentence or clause as a whole. Unlike an adjective, an adverb can be found in various places within the sentence

She ran "quickly"
