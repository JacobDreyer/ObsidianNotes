##### Question 16
In the construction industry, compressive strength of concrete is a crucial characteristic. Suppose that for a particular residential construction job, the concrete tested after 3 days should have a mean compression strength of $\mu = 3000$
with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 50$ . It is known that compressive strength of concrete is Normally distributed. On a construction site, a sample of n = 5 specimens is selected and tested after 3 days. If the concrete has the desired characteristics, what is the probability that the sample mean $\bar x$  will be larger than 3060 psi?
- [ ] .996
- [ ] .004
- [ ] .885
- [ ] .115
- [ ] This can’t be determined, because the sample size n = 5 is much too small to rely on the Normal distribution for calculation of the required probability.
