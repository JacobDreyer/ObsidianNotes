##### Question 1
As you increase the margin of error in a confidence interval,
- [ ] The Confidence interval increases
- [ ] the confidence interval decreases
- [ ] The confidence interval remains the same

##### Question 2
The time needed for college students to complete a certain paper-andpencil maze follows a Normal distribution with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of 3 seconds. You wish to see whether the mean time $\mu$ is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a group of nine college students exercise vigorously for 30 minutes and then complete the maze. Assume that $\sigma$ remains unchanged at 3 seconds. The hypotheses you decide to test are $H_0:\mu = 30$ versus $H_a:\mu\neq 30$ Suppose it takes the nine students an average of $\bar x$ = 32.05 seconds to complete the maze. At the 1% significance level, what can you conclude?
- [ ] $H_0$ should be rejected because the P-value is less than 0.01
- [ ] $H_0$ should not be rejected because the P-value is greater than 0.01.
- [ ] $H_0$ should be rejected because the P-value is less than 0.01.
- [ ] $H_0$ should not be rejected because the P-value is greater than 0.01.

##### Question 3
Is the mean height for all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21 now over 6 feet? Let $\mu$ represent the population mean height of all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21. What are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?
- [ ] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu < 6$
- [ ] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu \neq 6$
- [ ] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu > 6$

##### Question 4
It is known that driving can be difficult in regions where winter conditions involve snow-covered roads. For cars equipped with all-season tires traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, the mean stopping time in fresh snow is known to be 215 meters, with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.5$ meters. It is often claimed that automobiles in such areas should be equipped with special tires to compensate for such conditions, especially with respect to stopping distance. A manufacturer of tires made for driving in fresh snow claims that vehicles equipped with its tires have a decreased stopping distance. A study was done using a random sample of nine snow tires from the manufacturer on a snow-covered test track. The tests resulted in a mean stopping distance of $\bar x$ = 212.9 meters. Using the sample results, and assuming that stopping distance is a Normally distributed random variable, what is the value of the test statistic?
- [ ] 0.05
- [ ] -2.52
- [ ] -9.36
- [ ] -1.04
- [ ] -1.96

##### Question 5
Assume the red areas in the figures represent the P-values calculated from a data set. Which figure has the larger P-value?
![[Pasted image 20221108210956.png]]
- [ ] Figure 1
![[Pasted image 20221108211024.png]]
- [ ] Figure 2
- [ ] Both have approximately the same P-Value

##### Question 6
Confidence intervals are resistant to outliers in the data set.
- [ ] True
- [ ] False

##### Question 7
A study was conducted on the reaction time of female subjects over the age of 50 to a particular light stimulus using a specific type of red light. A random sample of 45 female subjects from this age group in the population was selected, and the subjectsâ€™ reaction times (in seconds) were determined. Based on the test data, the 99% confidence interval estimate for $\mu$ was determined to be (0.66, 0.78). From this interval we can conclude that
- [ ] this interval contains the sample mean with probability 0.99.
- [ ] this interval has a probability of 0.99 of enclosing the true mean $\mu$
- [ ] in the long run, this interval will contain the true mean $\mu$ 99% of the time.
- [ ] we have 99% confidence in this interval, because in repeated sampling from the population, the method used to determine such confidence intervals will produce intervals 99% of which will contain $\mu$
- [ ] we have 99% confidence that this interval contains $\mu$ , because if we repeated testing over and over again, 99% of the time this interval would contain $\mu$

##### Question 8
Practical significance will always lead to statistical significance
- [ ] true
- [x] false

##### Question 9
If the P-value is as small as or smaller than a specified value of $\alpha$, then the data are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ significant.
- [ ] pratically
- [x] statistically
- [ ] absoloutely

##### Question 10
Researchers are studying the yield of a crop in two locations. The researchers are going to compute independent 90% confidence intervals for the mean yield at each location. What is the probability that at least one of the intervals will cover the true mean yields at their location?
- [ ] 0.81
- [ ] 0.19
- [ ] 0.99
- [ ] 0.95
