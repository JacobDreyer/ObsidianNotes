Hunters from [[The Old World]] (The Eastern Hemisphere) were the first to arrive in North America about 40,000 years ago

They crossed the [[Beringia Land Bridge]] from [[Serbia]] to [[Alaska]] and then some continued east into [[Yukon]] and others travelled south along the coast

The land bridge was accessible at the time because sea level was much lower than it is today

As the continental sheet ice retreated, descendants of the hunters travelled along the ice-free corridor that opened along the foothills of [[The Rocky Mountains]]

They commonly hunted mammoths with pointed spears.

Mammoths became extinct due to climate change and hunting about 11,000 years ago.

The First People changed to a mixed diet with meat (buffalo and Caribou), fish and plants.

The revised diet allowed the first people to remain in a specific geographic territory

This led to seperate groups of social units which marked the beginning of [[Indigenous Tribes]]
