### [[Canada at Confederation]]
![[Canada at Confederation]]

Canada became a country in 1867 when four small British colonies united: [[Upper Canada]] ([[Ontario]]), [[Lower Canada]], ([[Quebec]]), [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]]

Upper Canada = Up stream of [[The St. Lawrence River]]
Lower Canada =  Down stream of [[The St. Lawrence River]]

These became the first four provinces

[[Britain]] was eager for the colonies to form a union to withstand possible annexation by the [[United States]]

### Land Transfer
[[Rupert's Land]] and [[The North-Western Territory]] were controlled by the [[The Hudson's Bay Company]]. in 1870, these lands were sold to the federal government.

The federal government felt it was important to purchase and organize this land because:
- It would diminish the threat of US settlers annexing the land
- The transport of grain would provide freight for a planned cross-continent railroad

### [[Quebec]]
[[Quebec]] agreed to confederation because it would bring several benefits:
- Union with the three other colonies would strengthen the overall economy and protect against potential [[US]] annexation
- [[French]] was an official language of the federal government and freedom of religion was a right
- Provinces were given control over education
- Working especially with [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] could influence federal politics and shape the future of Canada as the West continued to grow
