Draw independent observations at random from any population with finite [[Mean]] $\mu$

```ad-tldr
title: Definition
The Law of large numbers says that as the number of observations drawn increases, the sample mean of the observed values gets closer and closer to the mean $\mu$ of the population
```

Note: The law of small numbers does not hold: We expect even short sequences of random events to show the kind of average behavior that, in fact, appears only in the long run
