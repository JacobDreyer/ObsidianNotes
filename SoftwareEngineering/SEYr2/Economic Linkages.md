### Economic Linkages for Growth
Three types of economic linkages are necessary for economic growth and job creation:

Backward Linkage: Supplies for the staple industry (Saws and tools for the lumber industry)

Foward Linkage: Local Procession before export (squaring the lumber)

Final Demand Linkage: Servicing the needs of workers and families (stores, schools, etc.)
