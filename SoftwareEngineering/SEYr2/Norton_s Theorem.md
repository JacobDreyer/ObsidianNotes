a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source ($I_n$) in parallel with a resistor $R_t$
- $I_n$ = $i_{sc}$
- $R_t$ is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals

1. Determine the open circuit voltage
2. Determine the short circuit current
3. Find Thevenin's equivalent resistance
4. $V_t = R_tI_n$
5. The Thevenin's equivalent circuit consisting of a Voltage source in series with $R_t$ 
6. The Norton's equivalent circuit consisting of a current source in parallel iwth $R_t$
