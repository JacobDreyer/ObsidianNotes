A JavaScript string is one of the 3 basic data types in JS

- It is any value surrounded by:
	- Double Quotes: "Do Stuff"
	- Single Quotes: 'Do Stuff'
	- Back Ticks: \`Do Stuff\`

##### Operators:
- Concatenation (+)
	- "Do " + 'Stuff' $\to$ "Do Stuff"
- \\t in a string results in a tab
- \\n in a string results in a new line

With Back Ticks:
- they can contain expression enclosed in: ${...}
- they can contain line breaks without breaking the string
