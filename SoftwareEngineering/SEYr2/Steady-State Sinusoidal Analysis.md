- [[Circuit]]s with [[Sinusoidal Sources]] have many important applications
- For example, [[Electrical Power]] is distributed to residences and buisnesses by [[Sinusoidal Current]]s and [[Voltage]]s
- [[Sinusoidal Voltage]]s and currents have many uses in radio communication
- Also, it is well known that all signals of practical interest are composed of sinusoidal components
- Thus, the study of circuits with sinusoidal sources is a central theme in [[Electrical Engineering]]
- A sinusoidal voltage is shown in Fig. 1 and is given by:
$$ v(t) = V_m\cos(\omega t + \theta) $$
- Where:
	- $V_m$ = the peak value of the voltage
	- $\omega\;(=2\pi f)$ = [[Angular Frequency]] in Radians/sec; 
		- $f$ = [[Frequency]] in [[Hz]] or cycles/sec
	- $\theta$ = the [[Phase Angle]]

- Sinusoidal signals are [[Periodic]], repeating the same pattern of values in each period T
- [[Sine]] or [[Cosine]] function completes one cycle when the angle increases by $2\pi$ radians, we get
$$ \omega T = 2\pi $$
- The [[Frequency]] of a periodic signal is the number of cycles completed in one second. Thus:
$$ f = \frac1T $$
- The units of frequency is [[Hz]] (cycles/second)
- For uniformity we express sinusoidal functions using cosine function rather than sine function
- Sine and cosine are related through the identity:
$$ \sin(x) = \cos(x - 90^o) $$
