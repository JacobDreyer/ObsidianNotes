The region was the first part of [[North America]] to be discovered by european explorers

[[Vikings]] from [[Norway]] established a settlement at [[L'anse aux Meadows]] aproximately [[1000 AD]]. This site is the northernmost point of the island of [[Newfoundland]]

Italian explorer [[John Cabot]] reached [[Newfoundland]] in [[1497]] while searching for a route to [[Asia]]

By the [[1700s]], the population of the Atlantic region was a mix of [[British]], [[French]] ([[Acadian]]s) and [[Indigenous People]]s ([[Mi'kmaq]])

The [[French]] surrendered [[Acadia]] (What is now the [[Maritime Provinces]]) to the [[British]] under [[The Treaty of Utrecht]] in [[1713]]

The [[English]] gained dominance in the area after the expulsion of [[Acadian]]s

Following the treaty, the [[Acadians]] refused to sign an oath of allegiance to [[Britain]] and some participated in military operations against the [[British]]

From [[1755]] - [[1764]] the British deported the majority of [[Acadian]]s (over 11,000)

Many acadians migrated to [[France]] or to [[Louisiana]] where they influenced the culture of [[New Orleans]]

### [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]]
![[St. Pierre and Miquelon]]

[[The US War of Independence]] ([[1775]]-[[1783]]) impacted the historic settlement of the Atlantic region.

Following the victory by the [[US]], 40,000 [[British Loyalists]] migrated to [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]

Waves of immigrants from [[The British Isles]] continued over the next 100 years

The [[Scottish]] tended to settle on [[Cape Breton Island]] and the [[Irish]] around [[Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]]

### Early Economic Growth
In the early [[1800s]], harvesting of the area's natural resources by [[Britain]] was rampant

The availibility of [[Timber]] and the seaside location provided ideal conditions for ship building for the [[British Navy]]

Just before [[Confederation]], [[Iron]] replaced [[Wood]] as the main resource for shipbuilding.

### [[Confederation]]
[[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] joined [[Canada]] at the time of Confederation

[[PEI]] became the 7th province in [[1873]]

[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] joined as the 10th province in [[1949]]

All were rather reluctant to join due to the far distance from major markets in the rest of [[Canada]]

[[The Intercolonial Railway]] from [[Montreal]] to [[Halifax]] played a role in luring [[The Maritimes]] to join [[Confederation]]

This gave access to the larger markets and allowed maritime buisnesses to grow

However, [[The National Policy]] led to the development of [[Southern Ontario]] and [[Southern Quebec]] as the main manufacturing area in [[Canada]] and ultimately resulting in the atlantic region remaining as a [[Periphery]]

### Linking the Island of [[Newfoundland]]
After [[Newfoundland]] joined [[Confederation]], the federal government commited to completing [[The Trans-Canada Highway]] across [[Newfoundland]] in [[1965]]

The federal government operates a daily year-round ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Port Aux Basques]] and an overnight ferry in summer months to [[Argentia]]

### Linking [[Labrador]]
Geography has resulted in [[Labrador]] being drawn into the economic orbit of [[Quebec]]

Examples:
1. [[Hydroelectricty]] produced in [[Labrador]] is transmitted by power lines through [[Quebec]]
2. [[Iron Ore]] mined in [[Labrador]] is transported to the port of [[Sept-Iles]], [[Quebec]]
3. [[The Labrador-Quebec Highway]] connects [[Labrador]]'s largest city ([[Happy Valley - Goose Bay]]) to [[Quebec]]'s provincial highway system
