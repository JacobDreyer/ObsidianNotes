A test of significance is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a claim (also called hypothesis) the truth of which we want to asses
- The claim is a statement about a [[Parameter]] such as the population proportion p or the [[Population]] [[Mean]] $\mu$
- We express the results of a significance test in terms of [[Probability]], called the P-value, that measures how well the data and the claim agree

### Cautions
- What are the consequences of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true
- Are you conducting a preliminary study? if so you might want a larger $\alpha$ so you will be less likely to miss an interesting result

##### Some Conventions
- Typically that standards of our field of work are used

##### What Statistical Significance means
Statistical significance indicates only whether the effect observed is likely to be due to chance alone because of random sampling

Statistical significance may not be practically important

That's because statistical significance does not tell you about the magnitude of the effect, only that there is one

##### Do Not Ignore Lack of Significance
Having no proof that a particular suspect committed a murder does not imply that the suspect did not commit the murder.

##### Potential Imprtance of Small Effects

There is no consensus on how big an effect must be in order to be considered meaningful. In some cases, effects that may appear to be trivial can be very important.

##### Beware of Searching for Significance
- You cannot legitimately test a hypothesis using data that first suggested that hypothesis.
- When a large number of null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, it can be expected that several of the tests will show significance, even when all the null hypotheses are true.
- The previous two points do not imply that exploratory data analysis is a bad thing. Exploratory analysis often leads to interesting discoveries. However, if the data at hand suggest an interesting theory, then test that theory on a new set of data!

### Errors
- If we reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true we have commited a ==Type I Error==
- If we fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false we have commited a ==Type II Error==

When $\alpha$ (probability of type I error) gets larger the probability of a Type II error $\beta$  gets smaller
