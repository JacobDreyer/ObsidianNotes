### Rules for Seats in the House of Commons
1. Each province must have at least MP's as it has [[Senator]]s
	-  This explains why [[PEI]] has 4 MPs even though its population is only 140,000
2. Each province must have at least as many MPs as it did in 1976
	-  This rule was probably in place to appease [[Quebec]] to prevent them from leaving
