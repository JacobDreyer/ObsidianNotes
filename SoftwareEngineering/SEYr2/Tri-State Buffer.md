title: Definition

a circuit element with two inputs and 1 output. One of these inputs is a control input. When the control input is active (usually mean set to 1), the output mirrors the second input. When the control input is inactive the output is high impedance: it acts as an open circuit.
```

The possible output for a tri-state buffer is often listed as 1, 0, and Z where Z is the high impedance state.

### Tri-State Gate
Tri-State Buffers are common enough that they are often implicitly included in the symbol for another logic element
