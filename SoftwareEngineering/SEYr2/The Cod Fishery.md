When the industry collapsed, many fishers in [[Newfoundland]] were forced to turn to government assistance

Mismanagement of the cod fishery was based on three factors:
1. Estimates of the cod stocks by [[The Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] were too high
2. There was strong pressure for high [[Cod]] quantities from [[Newfoundland]] politicians to increase revenue
3. [[Canada]] does not have control over the outer regions of [[The Grand Banks]]

The federal government placed a [[Moratorium]] on [[Cod Fishing]] in [[1992]]

It is still not known how long it will take for the [[Cod]] stock to fully recover

[[Cod]] do not reproduce until the age of 7 years
