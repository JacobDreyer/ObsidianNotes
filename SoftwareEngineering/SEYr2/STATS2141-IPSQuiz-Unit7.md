Bags of a certain brand of tortilla chips claim to have a net weight of 14 ounces. Net weights actually vary slightly from bag to bag. Assume net weights are Normally distributed. A representative of a consumer advocate group wishes to see whether there is any evidence that the mean net weight is less than advertised and so intends to test the hypotheses $H_0:\mu = 14$ versus $H_A: \mu<14$ To do this, he selects 16 bags of tortilla chips of this brand at random and determines the net weight of each. He finds a sample mean of 13.88 ounces with a standard deviation of s = .24 ounce. What is the value of the test statistic?
1. t=-.5
2. t=-2
3. t=-8
4. t=-8.33

To estimate $\mu$ the mean salary of full professors at American colleges and universities, you obtain the salaries of a random sample of 400 full professors. The sample mean is $73,220 and the sample standard deviation is $4400. What is a 99% confidence interval for the mean $\mu$
