Establish Credibility:

The introductory stlyes of Thoesen and Arntfield both work to accomplish the same goal yet through different strategies. Both presentations make it their goal to relate to the viewers as soon as possible. However, Thoesen starts speaking about common experiences and reasons that the viewers can relate too. Meanwhile Arntfield uses a question to acoomplish this. He asks the question and gets the audience to interact with it rather than just having them listen. After the initial introduction both presenters then introduce a shock factor. Thoesen explains that exploring Mars is necessary for survival and Arntfield introduces the plummeting solve rate of murders. Overally, I think both presenters do a good job of capturing the audience's attention and use the same general strategy just in different ways.
