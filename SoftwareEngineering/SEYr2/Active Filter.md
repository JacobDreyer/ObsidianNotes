- Drawbacks of [[Passive Filter]]s
	- Passive Filters cannot generate gain greater than 1
	- Passive elements cannot add energy to the network
	- Passive filters may require bulky and expensive [[Inductor]]s
- Active Filters consist of combinations of [[Resistors]], [[Capacitor]]s and [[Operational Amplifier]]s
- Active Filters are smaller and less expensive, as they do not require [[Inductor]]s
- This aspect makes the Integrated Circuit realizations of filters easy and compact
- Also, a major advantage of active filters is that they can provide amplifier gain in addition to providing the same frequency response of [[RLC Pasive Filters]]
- Active Filters can be combined with [[Buffer Amplifier]]s ([[voltage follower]]) to isolate each stage of the filter from source and load impedance effects
- Filters are often classified according to their [[Order]] (or # of poles) or their design type
