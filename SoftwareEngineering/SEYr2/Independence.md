If two events A and B do not influence each other, and if knowledge about one does not change the probability of the other, the events are said to be independent of each other

##### [[The Multiplication Rule]] for Independent Events
If A and B are independent:
$$ P(A\; and\; B) = P(A)\times P(B) $$
