## Scatterplots
- shows the relationship between two quantitative variables measured on the same cases

#### Interpreting Scatterplots
- As in any graph of data, look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern.
	- You can describe the overall pattern of a scatterplot by the form, direction, and strength of the relationship.
	- An important kind of departure are [[Outliers]], an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern of the relationship.

- Two variables are ==positively associated== when above-average values of one tend to accompany above-average values of the other and when below-average values also tend to occur together.
- Two variables are ==negatively associated== when above-average values of one tend to accompany below-average values of the other, and vice versa.

#### The Log Transformation
- Apply a transformation to the ==data== that renders the relationship approximately linear
- Can only be use for variable values that are positive
