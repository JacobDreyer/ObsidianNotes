A [[Sample]] is the part of the [[Population]] from which we actually collect information.  We use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population

#### How to [[Sample]] Badly
The design of a sample is [[Bias]]ed if it systematically favours certain outcomes.

Choosing individuals simply because they are easy to reach results in a convenience sample

A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by responding to a general appeal. 
This shows [[Bias]] because people with strong opinions are more likely to respond.

#### Random Sampling
central principle of statistical sampling

A simple random sample of size n consists of n individuals from the population, chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the sample actually selected

#### Probability Samples: 
##### Stratified Random Samples
A probability sample is a sample chosen by chance. We must know what samples are possible and chance, or probability, of being chosen each possible sample has.

Some times there are statistical advantages to using more complex sampling methods. One common alternative involves sampling important groups within the population seperateley.

To select a stratified random sample first classify the population into groups of similar individuals called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine these SRSs to form the full sample

##### Multistage Random Samples
Uses probability samples in a series of stages
Ex.
Stage 1:
- Divide US into 2007 geographical areas called primary sampling units, or PSUs. Select a sample of PSUs
Stage 2:
- Divide each PSU into smaller areas called blocks
- Select a sample of the blocks within each PSU selected in Stage 1
Stage: 3
- Sort the housing units in each block into clusters of four nearby units
- Select an SRS of these clusters and conduct interviews

#### Cautions about [[Sample Surveys]]
Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error and [[Bias]]

Undercoverage: occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process of choosing the sample

Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample cannot be contacted or refuses to participate

A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads to a response bias

The wording of the questions is the most important influence on the answers given to a sample survey

```ad-important
Insist on knowing the exact questions asked, the rate of non-response, and the date and method of the survey before you trust a poll result
