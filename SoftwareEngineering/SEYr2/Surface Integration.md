Length of an Arc:
$$ s = \int_a^b\sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}\;dx $$
Now we ask:
- Find the Area A(s) of a portion of surface S defined by $z = f(x,y)$
- This is the [[Surface Area]]

let $f$ be a function for which the first [[Partial Derivative]]s $f_x$ and $f_y$ are continuous on a closed region $R$. Then the area of the surface over $R$ is:
$$ A(s) = \iint_R \sqrt{1 + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x})^2 + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial y})^2}\; dA $$

[[Differential Surface Area]]:
$$ dS = \sqrt{1 + \partial_x f^2 + \partial_y f^2} \;dA $$
$$ \partial _xf = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\qquad \qquad \partial _yf = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} $$

- [[Double Integral]] $\iint_R f(x,y) dA$ is a generalization of definite integral: $\int_a^bf(x)dx$
- $A(s) = \iint_R \sqrt{1 + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x})^2 + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial y})^2}\; dA$ ([[Surface Area Integral]]) is a generalization of [[Arc-Length Integral]]: $s = \int_a^b\sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}\;dx$
- Now we introduce the [[Surface Integral]] as a generalization of a [[Line Integral]] ($\int_C G(x,y))ds$
