### [[Agriculture]]
Agriculture was the driving force behind the settlement and early development of the [[Praries]]

[[Wheat]] has historically been the most valuable crop, but [[Canola]] has become increasingly common.

Higher prices for [[Canola]] today have been triggered by the increasing demand for [[Ethanol]] as an alternative fuel for vehicles

#### Agricultural Belts
![[Pasted image 20230329133720.png]]

Agricultural land in the [[Prairie Provinces]] is divided into the [[Fertile Belt]], [[Dry Belt]], and [[Agricultural Fringe]]

The major differences among these areas are the length of the growing season and the amount of soil moisture

In the [[Agricultural Fringe]], the grain grown is of lower quality and is primarily used to raise livestock

#### [[Livestock Industry]]
Livestock processing is an important secondary sector industry in the [[Praries]]

As with other resouces, the main export market is the [[US]]

There are large slaughtering plants in [[Brandon]], [[Red Deer]], and [[Lethbridge]]

### [[Oil Industry]]
of the [[Oil]] that [[Canada]] exports today, most goes to the [[US]] (98%)

The oil industry in currently supports over 500,000 jobs in [[Canada]]

Due to improved regulations, the [[Cabon Dioxide]] emmissions per barrel of oil produced in the [[Oil Sands]] has fallen 37% since 2000

[[Fort McMurray]] is the major oil production centre 

There is also minor production activity in [[Southeastern Saskatchewan]] and [[Southwestern Manitoba]]

The [[Sedimentary Rock]] underlying the western [[Praries]] contains valuable deposits of [[Fossil Fuels]]

Technological advancements during the [[1970s]] created a method to seperate the [[Oil]] from sand and therefore allowing output to greatly increase

Vast amounts of [[Oil]] that are mixed with sand is called [[Bitumen]]

[[Bitumen]] is mixed with hot water and transported to processing plants where large [[Hydrocarbon]] [[molecules]] are broken into smaller ones

The product is then supplied to refineries through pipelines which then processes it into [[Gasoline]], [[Diesel]], and [[Propane]] (one such pipeline terminates in [[Sarnia]])

#### Enviromental Issues
The [[Oil Industry]] faces the problem of what to do with the vast quantities of waste products.

The water that is used to seperate [[Oil]] from sand becomes toxic and then cannot be released into local rivers or lakes

The amount of toxic water is increasing daily and is stored in vast [[Tailing Pond]]s

Leakage from the ponds can affect groudwater or nearby suface water, including [[The Athabasca River]]

Regulationg require oil companies to reclaim the [[Tailing Pond]]s currently housing the toxic sludge

New projects are underway to bury the sludge in deep pits and cover it with layers of soil
