The [[Confidence Level]] C is the overall capture rate if the method is used many times.

The [[Sample Mean]] will vary from sample to sample, but when we use the method "estimate $\pm$ margin of error" to get each interval, C x 100% of all intervals capture the unknown population [[Mean]] $\mu$

#### Interpretating a [[Confidence Level]]
To say we are 95% confident means:

"95% of all possible samples of a given size from this population will yield intervals that capture the unknown parameter"
