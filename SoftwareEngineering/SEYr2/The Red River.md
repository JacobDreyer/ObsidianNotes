### Flooding
The Red river flows from south to north through very flat land with relatively impermeable [[Chernozemic Soil]]

In the Spring, a melting snowpack at the head of the river (in the south) adds to the discharge

At the same time, ice at the mouth of the river (in the north) creates a damming effect
