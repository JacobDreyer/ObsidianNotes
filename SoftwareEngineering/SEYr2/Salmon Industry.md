Regulating [[Salmon]] fishing is challenging because they migrate long distances

[[Salmon]] may spawn in [[Canadian Waters]] but then migrate to [[US Waters]]

This problem is an example of the [[Tragedy of the Commons]]

[[Tragedy of the Commons]]: The destruction of renewable resources that are not privately owned

The main [[BC]] spawning area is the [[Fraser River]] and the [[Skeena River]]

The federal government is responsible for managing salmon and faces four issues:

1. [[Salmon]] spawn in rivers but migrate to oceans then return to rivers to spawn on a 5-year cycle
2. The [[Forestry Industry]] and [[Hydroelectric Industry]] have negatively impacted [[Salmon Spawning Grounds]]
3. [[Indigenous People]] are permitted to catch [[Salmon]] for sustinence
4. [[Salmon]] spawned in [[BC]] have been harvested by other countries in [[International Waters]]

The size of the catch is highly variable from year to year, but the overall trend has been downward.

Factors accounting for this:
- Pollution of fish habitat
- Warming Ocean temp
- Overfishing and high fish quotas
- Indigenous Fishery
