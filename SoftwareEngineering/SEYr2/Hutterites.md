Like the [[Amish]] and [[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]] have a very strong belief in [[Pacifism]]

They first immigrated to Canada from the US in 1918 because the US refused to exempt them from military service.

Hutterite colonies were established in the eastern prarie region.

Today there are over 30,000 hutterites in [[Canada]] living a quiet, communal lifestyle
