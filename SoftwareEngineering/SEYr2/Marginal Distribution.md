## Marginal Distribution
- The marginal distribution of one of the categorical variables in a [[Two-Way Table]] of counts is the distribution of values of that variable among all individuals described by the table

#### To Examine:
- Use the data in the table to calculate the marginal distribution (in percent) of the row or column totals
- Make a graph to display the marginal distribution

|                  | Female | Male | Total |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| Almost no Chance | 96     | 98   | 194   |
| Some chance      | 426    | 286  | 712   |
| A 50-50 Chance   | 696    | 720  | 1416  |
| A good Chance    | 663    | 758  | 1421  |
| Almost Certain   | 486    | 597  | 1083  |
| Total            | 2367   | 2459 | 4826      |

| Response         | Percent |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Almost No Chance | 4%      |
| Some Chance      | 14.8%   |
| A 50-50          | 29.3%   |
| A Good Chance    | 29.4%   |
| Almost Certain   | 22.4%   |
