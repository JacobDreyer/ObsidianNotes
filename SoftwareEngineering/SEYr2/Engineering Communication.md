### Eng Communication vs Science Writing
The goal of most Engineering documents is actual implementation (immediate real world impact)

Key characteristics that can ensure correct, safe, functional implementation of ideas is precision (correctness and/or accuracy)

But decisions we make regarding precision/accuracy (as well as objectivity, clarity) of communication begin prior to actual drafting

"Good communication decisions derive from understanding and practicing relevant strategies"
