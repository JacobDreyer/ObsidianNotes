[[Sydney]], [[Nova Scotia]] was formerly a major [[Iron]] and [[Steel]] producing centre in [[Canada]]

The air was heavily polluted and [[Tar Ponds]] contained waste products from the [[Steel Mill]]

Toxic Chemicals began leaking into a nearby creek and contaminated groundwater in the area

In the late [[1990s]] people living in the vicinity had the highest [[Cancer]] rates in [[Canada]]

The Sydney tar ponds were the site of the biggest enviromental clean up project in [[Canada]]

From [[1998]] to [[2012]] the federal and [[Nova Scotia]] governments spent a combined $400 M on clean up

The ponds were solidified with a cement-like-mixture and then buried with soil
