The river features very prominently in [[Quebec's History]] and [[Quebec's Economy]]

It is an essential part of water-based transportation in [[North America]] because it connects the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]

[[Dredging]] the river was required in order to prevent large freighters from running aground

[[Canal]]s were constructed to allow ships to pass around rapids or waterfalls within the river.

These became part of [[The St. Lawrence Seaway]] which opened in [[1959]]
