- Motivation
	- It's important for some classes to have exactly one instance
- Intent
	- Ensure that only one instance of a class is created
	- Provide a global point of access to the object
- Structure
	- Singleton
		- Defines an instance operation that lets clients access its unique instance.
		- Responsible for creating and maintaining its own unique instance
- Solution - Use the singleton pattern when:
	- There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point
	- Example:
	- Logger Classes
		- These classes are implemented as a singletons and provides a global logging access point in all the application components without being necessary to create an object each time a logging operation is performed
