A Block is a group of [[Experimental Unit]]s that are known, before the [[Experiment]], to be similar in some way that is expected to affect the response to the [[Treatment]]s

In a Block Design, the random assignment of [[Experimental Unit]]s to [[Treatment]]s is carried out seperately in each block

##### Process
Form blocks based on the most important unavoidable sources of variability ([[Lurking Variables]]) among the [[Experimental Unit]]s

Randomization will average out the effects of the remaining [[Lurking Variables]] and allow an unbiased comparison of the [[Treatment]]s

```ad-summary
Control what you can, block what you cannot (form blocks), and randomize to create comparable groups
```
