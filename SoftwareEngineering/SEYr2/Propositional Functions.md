## Propositional Functions
Let D be some collection of objects and suppose for every object x in D we have a proposition P(x). We call this a propositional function and D the domain of discourse of P.

A propositional function is not true of false. for for all x in the domain there is a propositionP(x) which is either true or false

Ex. Let D be all Integers for each integer n we have a statement P(n): n$\neq$ 0
$1 \neq 0$ is true.    $0\neq0$ is false
