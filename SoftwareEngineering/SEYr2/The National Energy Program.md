Energy prices rose dramatically through the 1970s. In the mid 1970s, the [[Federal Government]] agreed to match the domestic oil price to the world oil price which was very high at the time.

This resulted in huge oil revenues for Alberta

in 1980, the liberal federal government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] changed this with the initiation of the program

Under the program, the federal government refused to continue to match the domestic oil price with the world oil price.

Objectives:
- Ensure a lower cost of oil for Canadians
- Redistribute the revenue from the oil industry to the federal governement and other provinces

As the federal government gained revenue from the resulting profits, the revenue to [[Alberta]] fell. 

The result was a distrust of Liberal politicians by Alberta that is still evident today.

Alberta did not elect any Liberal MP's in the 1984, 1988, 2006, 2008, or 2011 federal elections

In the 2015 federal election won by [[Justin Trudeau]], only 4 of Alberta's 34 ridings voted Liberal. These ridings were urbanized and located within the city.
