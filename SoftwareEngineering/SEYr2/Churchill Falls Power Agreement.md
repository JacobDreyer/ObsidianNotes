For power to be exported from [[Churchill Falls Hydroelectric Project]] to the [[US]] it must be transmitted through [[Quebec]]

[[Quebec]] refused to allow this and instead negotiated a deal to but power produced from the project

The deal allows [[Quebec]] to buy power from [[Churchill Falls Hydroelectric Project]] at [[1969]] prices until [[2041]]

The agreement has resulted in resentment toward [[Quebec]] among residents of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]
