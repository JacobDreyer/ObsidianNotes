## Least-Squares Regression
#### Regression Line
- A regression line is a straight line that describes how a response variable y changes as an explanatory variable x changes.
- We can use a regression line to predict the value of y for a given value of x
- When a scatterplot displays a linear pattern we can describe the overall pattern by drawing a straight line throught the points
- Regression equation:
$$ \hat y = b_0 + b_1x $$
- $x$ = value of Explanatory Variable
- $\hat y$ = predicted value of the response variable for a given value of x

#### Least-Squares Regression Line
- The least squares regression line of y on x is the line that minimizes the sum of tthe squares of the vertical distances of the data points from the line
