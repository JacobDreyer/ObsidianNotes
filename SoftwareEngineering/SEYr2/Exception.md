## Exceptions
- A [[Runtime Error]] that prevents a program to run normally
- May result due to
	- unavailible resource
	- unexpected input
	- or [[Logic Error]] on the part of the programmer
- Exceptions are objects generated by code that encounters an unexpected situation
- Labelled as "An exception is thrown"
- Program will end gracefully with an error
- Also provides the option to continue the program by handling the exception within the code
	- Known as [[Exception Handling]]

#### [[System Errors]]
- [[Linkage Error]]
- [[Virtual Machine Error]]
- [[AWT Error]]
- Rarely Occur
- There is little we can do with System errors

### Pros and Cons:
- Pros:
	- Exception handling separates error-handling code from normal programming tasks, thus making programs easier to read and mody
- Cons:
	- Exception handling usually requires more time and resources because it requires:
		- instantiating a new Exception object
		- rolling back the call stack
		- propogating the errors to the calling methods

### When to Throw Exceptions
- An exception occurs in a method
- If one wants the exception to be processed by its caller, one should create an exception object and throw it.
- If one can handle the exception in the method where it occurs, there is no need to throw it. (see the slides with code-examples)

### When to Use Exceptions
- When should you use the try-catch block in the code? 
	- You should use it to deal with unexpected error conditions. Do not use it to deal with simple, expected situations. For example, see the code in the following slide

### Creating Checked Custom Exception Classes
- Create checked custom exception classes if and only if the predefined classes are not sufficient.
- Declare checked custom exception classes by extending Exception or a subclass of Exception.
