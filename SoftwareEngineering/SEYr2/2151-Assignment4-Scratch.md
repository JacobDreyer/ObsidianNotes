#### Question 3
Let a, b be integers with a, b relatively prime. Let 0 ≤ r ≤ b − 1. Show that there is an integer x with $[ax]_b$ = $[r]_b$. Hint: If you get stuck look over the lecture notes for things that may help.

$$ [ax]_b = ax + bk $$
$$ [r]_b = r + bk $$







#### Question 4
Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using the following hints. Assume for a contradiction that there are finitely many primes. Since you have finitely many primes, you can list them out,say we let p1, p2, . . . , pn be the finitely many primes. Now let N = p1...pn. That is, N is the product of all the finitely many primes. Now consider 1 + N. This is some integer, so 1 + N is a product of primes q1...qs by the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic. As each of the qi is prime we have q1 = pj for some j because p1, ..., pn is every single prime number by our assumption.

Assume there are finite amount of prime numbers

let N be the product of all primes p1-pn
Let N+1 be the product of all primes p1-pn + 1 or q1-qs

as each of the qi is prime we have q1=pj because every single prime number is listed

however N+1 contains an additional prime qs which is impossible because we stated that N contained all of the finite primes.
