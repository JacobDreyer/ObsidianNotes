Assume the negation of the conclusion and work towards the negation of the hypothesis.

Works well with things like irrational numbers which are hard to represent whereas the opposite (rational numbers) are easy to represent

Prove: $\phi \to \psi$ 
Assume:
$\neg \psi$ 
Show:
$\neg \phi$
$$ \neg\psi\to \neg\phi $$

Ex. if 7x+9 is even then x is odd

if x is even then 7x+9 is odd
7x is even
even + odd = odd
