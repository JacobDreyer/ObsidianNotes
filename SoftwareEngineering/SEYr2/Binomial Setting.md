A binomial setting arises when we perform several independent trials of the same chance process and record the number of times that a paticular outcome occurs.

The four conditions (called BINS) for a binomial setting are as follows:
- ==Binary?== The possible outcomes of each trial can be classified as "success" or "failure"
- ==Independent?== Trials must be independent; that is, the result of one trial must not have any effect on the result of any other trial
- ==Number?== The number of trials $n$ of the chance process must be fixed in advance
- ==Success?== The [[Probability]] $p$ of success must be the same on every trial
