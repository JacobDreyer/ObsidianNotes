#### The [[Standard Deviation]]
- The most common measure of spread looks at how far each observation is from the mean. This measure is called the standard deviation.
- measures the average distance of the observations from their mean.
$$ s_x^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \bar x)^2 + (x_2-\bar x)^2 + \cdots + (x_n-\bar x)^2}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum(x_i-\bar x)^2 $$
- s measures spread about the mean and should only be used  when the mean is an appropriate measure of centre
- s = 0 only when all observations are the same value
- s is not resistant to outliers
- s has same units of measurements as the data
- $\bar x$ = mean
