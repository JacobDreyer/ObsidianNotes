##### Question 1
The actual arrival time of the commuter bus at the final bus stop as compared to the scheduled arrival time is known to be Normally distributed with a mean of 1 minute and a standard deviation of 3 minutes (a negative value meaning the bus arrived early, a positive value meaning the bus arrived late). You ride the bus frequently and are under the impression that the mean arrival time is much later than the commuter bus service claims. You decide to test the hypotheses $H_0: \mu = 1$ versus $H_a:\mu > 1$. You take a simple random sample of 10 trips and record the differences between the actual arrival time and the scheduled arrival time. You decide to reject H0 if x>3 If, in fact, the true mean is 2 minutes, what is the probability of a Type II error?
- [ ] .1459
- [ ] .8541
- [ ] .95
- [ ] .9825

##### Question 2
The heights of a simple random sample of 400 male high school sophomores in a midwestern state are measured. The sample mean is $\bar x = 66.2$ inches. Suppose that the heights of male high school sophomores follow a Normal distribution with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 4.1$ inches. Suppose the heights of a simple random sample of 100 male sophomores, rather than 400, were measured. Which of the following statements is true?
- [ ] The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval would increase.
- [ ] The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval would decrease.
- [ ] The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval would stay the same because the level of confidence has not changed.
- [ ] The standard deviation would decrease

##### Question 3
Is the mean height for all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21 now over 6 feet? Let $\mu$ represent the population mean height of all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21. What are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?
- [ ] $H_0:\mu=6$ vs $H_a:\mu<6$
- [ ] $H_0:\mu=6$ vs $H_a:\mu\neq6$
- [ ] $H_0:\mu=6$ vs $H_a:\mu>6$

##### Question 4
The heights of young American women, in inches, are Normally distributed with a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.4$ A simple random sample of four young American women is selected, and their heights are measured. The four heights, in inches, are 63, 69, 62 and 66. Based on these data, what is a 99% confidence interval for $\mu$?
- [ ] $65.00 \pm 1.55$
- [ ] $65.00 \pm 2.35$
- [ ] $65.00 \pm 3.09$
- [ ] $65.00 \pm4.07$

##### Question 5
Confidence intervals are based on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ distribution.
- [ ] Sampling
- [ ] Population
- [ ] Uniform
- [ ] None of the Above

##### Question 6
Suppose a study was done to determine whether the average amount of sleep that students get the night before an exam is less than 6 hours. An SRS of 100 students from a university was taken, and a mean of 5.5 hours was computed from the sample. The figure below provides the results of the analysis.

Based on the results, the null hypothesis would \_\_\_\_\_\_ at the 0.10 significance level.
- [ ] be rejected
- [ ] not be rejected

##### Question 7
Small margins of error with high levels of confidence require \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
- [ ] a small number of observations
- [ ] a large number of observations
- [ ] discrete data
- [ ] a large population

##### Question 8
The lifetime (in hours) of a 60-watt light bulb is a random variable that has a Normal distribution with $\sigma = 30$ hours. A random sample of 25 bulbs tested produced a sample mean lifetime of $\bar x = 1038$ . What is the 92% confidence interval estimate for the mean lifetime $\mu$?
- [ ] (1022.1, 1053.9)
- [ ] (1027.5, 1048.5)
- [ ] (1026.2, 1049.8)
- [ ] (1028.1, 1047.9)
- [ ] (1022.5, 1053.5)

##### Question 9
Accepting the null hypothesis when in fact the alternative hypothesis is true is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
- [ ] a Type I error
- [ ] a Type II error
- [ ] the power

##### Question 10
Confidence intervals are resistant to outliers in the data set.
- [ ] True
- [ ] False

##### Question 11
\_\_\_\_\_\_significance indicates whether the observed differences between the sample mean and the population mean are based on variation due to random sampling.
- [ ] Practical
- [ ] Statistical

##### Question 12
The scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) are thought to be Normally distributed with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 10$ A simple random sample of 25 children is taken, and each is given the WISC. The mean of the 25 scores is $\bar x = 104.32$ Based on these data, what is a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$
- [ ] $104.32\pm.78$
- [ ] $104.32\pm3.29$
- [ ] $104.32\pm3.92$
- [ ] $104.32\pm19.6$

##### Question 13
A test of significance can be used to test differences in categorical data
- [ ] True
- [ ] False

##### Question 14
A researcher plans to conduct a test of hypotheses at the 1% significance level. She designs her study to have a power of 0.90 at a particular alternative value of the parameter of interest. What is the probability that the researcher will commit a Type I error?
- [ ] .01
- [ ] .1
- [ ] .9
- [ ] .99
