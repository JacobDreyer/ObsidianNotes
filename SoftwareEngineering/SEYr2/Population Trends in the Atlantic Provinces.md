Since [[Confederation]], the population of the [[Atlantic Provinces]] has grown at a rate well below the national average, and in some cases has declined:

From [[1996]] to [[2006]], the population of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] declined by .05%

During times of high oil prices (eg early [[2000s]]), approximately 7% of the workforce in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] lived in that province but worked in [[Alberta]]

### Rural Population
The population in the [[Atlantic Provinces]] is 46% rural, more than twice as high as the rest of [[Canada]] (20%)

When european settlers arrived, they searched for small sheltered harbours that would provide easy access to fishing

Villages developed around these harbours, but today many are in decline

Delivering health care, education, and social services to these villages is very costly

Many young people leave their villages in favour of larger urban centres

Since [[1945]], over 1000 villages with original populations of under 200 have disappeared
