- Only Operates on a scalar
	- (doesnt work on [[Parametric Curves]])

$$ \nabla = \hat i\frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \hat j\frac{\partial }{\partial y} + \hat k\frac{\partial }{\partial z} $$
- Not a physical vector itself
- It only has meaning when we apply it to a function of some kind
	- ([[Curl]] or [[Divergence]])
- There will be different ways we can apply/use the "grad" operator

- $\nabla$ sometimes called "del" rarely called "nabla"

$$ \nabla F(x,y,z) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\hat i + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\hat j + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}\hat k $$
"Grad F" gives us a vector function, the components of which tell us how much F varies with that corresponding direction

$$ (\nabla F)_x = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} $$
- How much does F change with changing x
