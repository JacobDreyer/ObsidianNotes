This was a clash in present day [[Saskatchewan]] in 1885 between the federal government and the [[Metis]] along with [[First Nations]] people.

Indigenous people living in the area felt threatened by an advancing wave of settelers.

They enlisted the support of Riel who was living in Montana at the time. Riel sent a petition to the federal government with demands but they were ignored.

By now the railroad was already completed, so they sent soldiers out.

An uprising began when an Indigenous group ambushed a Northwest Mounted Police contingent. It resulted in the deaths of 12 officers and 6 Indigenous People. 

The Canadian army advanced on the area and pushed back the Metis and other Indigenous forces.

Riel along with a total of 8 Indigenous Leaders were executed by hanging.
