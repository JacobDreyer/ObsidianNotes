title: Definition

Equivalence Class is the name given to a subset of some equivalence Relation R which includes all elements that are equivalent to each other
```

Let R be an equivalence relation on a set A. The set of all elements which are related to an element x of set A is called the equivalence class of x
$$ [x] = \{y | (x,y)\in R\} $$
==Set of all y such that x and y are related== (in a equivalent relation)

$[a]_n$ is the set of all solutions to $a = b\mod n$
which basically means a is the remainder of b divided by n
$$ [a]_n = a + bk_2 = nk_1 $$
