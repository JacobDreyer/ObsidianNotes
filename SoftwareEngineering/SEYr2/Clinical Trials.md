- Study the effectiveness of medical treatment on actual patients - these treatments can harm as well as heal
- Points for a Discussion:
	- Randomized comparative experiments are the only way to see the true effects of new treatments
	- Most benefits of clinical trials go to future patients. We must balance future benefits against present risks
	- The interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society
