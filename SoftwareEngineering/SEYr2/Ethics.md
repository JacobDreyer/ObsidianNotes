## Basic Data Ethics
The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people

- The organiztion that carries out the study must have an [[Institutional Review Board]] that reviews all planned studies in advance in order to protect the subjects from possible harm
- All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their [[Informed Consent]] before data are collected
- All individual data must be kept [[Confidential]]. Only statistical summaries for groups of subjects may be made public
