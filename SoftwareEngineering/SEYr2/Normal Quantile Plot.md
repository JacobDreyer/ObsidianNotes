## Normal Quantile Plot
- A way to assess whether a distribution is indeed approximately Normal
- Complex to do by hand but they are standard features in most statistical software
- What it means:
	- if the distribution is indeed Normal, the plot will show a straight line, indicating a good match between the data and a Normal distribution
	- Systematic deviations from a straight line indicate a non-Normla distribution. [[Outliers]] appear as points that are far away from the overall patern of the plot
