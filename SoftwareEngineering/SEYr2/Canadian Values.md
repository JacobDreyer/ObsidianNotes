Despite being a multicultural country there are core values of Canadian identity.

1. Government is based on the British system of parlimentary institutions
2. Two official languages ensure a place for [[French]] but no official standing for other languages
3. Some [[Indigenous People]]s have special rights from treaties and land claim agreements
4. All Canadians have equal rights as granted in the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] ([[1982]])
