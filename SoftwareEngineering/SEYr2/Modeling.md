### Why Modeling?
- Software engineering is a modeling activity
- Modeling is an important problem-solving technique, especially in software design
- Software engineers deal with complexity through modeling,
	- by focusing at any one time on only the relevant details and ignoring everything else
- A model is an abstract representation of a system that enables us to answer questions about the system
- Models are usefull when dealing with systems that are too large, too small, too complicated, or too expensive to experience first hand
