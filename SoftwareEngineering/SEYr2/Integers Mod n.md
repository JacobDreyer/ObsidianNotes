Let n be a positive integer. Then two integers a and b are said to be congruent mod n, written as $a\equiv b\; mod\; n$, if n|(a-b)

consider n = 5
k is some integer
$[0] = \{\cdots,-5,0,5,\cdots\} = 5k$
$[1] = \{\cdots,-4,1,6,\cdots\} = 1+5k$
$[2] = \{\cdots,-3,2,7,\cdots\} = 2+5k$
$[3] = \{\cdots,-2,3,8,\cdots\} = 3+5k$
$[4] = \{\cdots,-1,4,9,\cdots\} = 4+5k$

for \[1\] its essentially any number that when divided by n (5 in this case) produces a remainder of 1

#### Definition
Let n be a positive integer. The integers mod n consist of the set 
$\mathbb Z_n$ = {[0],[1],$\cdots$, [n-1]} together with
