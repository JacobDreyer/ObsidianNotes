Prepositions are used to link or indicate a relationship between nouns and pronouns and other elements of a sentence. They are found in front of (pre-positioned) their object and are combined with other words to make prepositional phrases

- I sat "on" the chair
- My meeting starts "at" 3
- I am leaving "for" a couple minutes

Think of prepositions as words of 'position' that inform us where somthing is with respect to both, time, place, or, location
