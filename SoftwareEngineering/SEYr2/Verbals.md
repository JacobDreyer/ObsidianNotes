Verbals are a subcategory of verbs that potentially prove tricky because while they are formed from and look like verbs, in function they operate as something else: either as modifiers ([[Adjective]] or [[Adverb]]) or [[Noun]]s

Three Verbals:
Infinitives (The "to" form)
Participles (Present and Past)
Gerunds

Verbals are verbs in form but another in function
