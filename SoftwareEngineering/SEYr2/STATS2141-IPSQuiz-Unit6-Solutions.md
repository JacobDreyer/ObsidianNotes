##### Question 1
As you increase the margin of error in a confidence interval,
- [x] The Confidence interval increases
- [ ] the confidence interval decreases
- [ ] The confidence interval remains the same

##### Question 2
The time needed for college students to complete a certain paper-andpencil maze follows a Normal distribution with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of 3 seconds. You wish to see whether the mean time $\mu$ is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a group of nine college students exercise vigorously for 30 minutes and then complete the maze. Assume that $\sigma$ remains unchanged at 3 seconds. The hypotheses you decide to test are $H_0:\mu = 30$ versus $H_a:\mu\neq 30$ Suppose it takes the nine students an average of $\bar x$ = 32.05 seconds to complete the maze. At the 1% significance level, what can you conclude?
- [ ] $H_0$ should be rejected because the P-value is less than 0.01
- [x] $H_0$ should not be rejected because the P-value is greater than 0.01.
- [ ] $H_0$ should be rejected because the P-value is less than 0.01.
- [ ] $H_0$ should not be rejected because the P-value is greater than 0.01.

First we want to calculate P-Value
![[Drawing 2022-11-08 20.33.49.excalidraw]]
P-Value = 2 x area of right shaded area = 2 x P($\bar x$ > 32.05 )

P($\bar x$ > 32.05 ) = probability that $\bar x$ is greater than 32.05

We now have to standardize both these values. recall [[Standardized Value]] $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$

$\mu$ is given as 30. and standard deviation of $\bar x = \sigma/\sqrt n$ 
$$ \mu = 30 \qquad \sigma = \frac{\sigma_2}{\sqrt n} = \frac3{\sqrt9} = 1 $$
$$ Pvalue = 2\times P(z > (32.05-30)/1) = 2\times P(z > 2.05) $$
$$ = 2\times P(z < -2.05) = 2\times .0202 = .0404 $$
Used Table of Standard Normal Probabilities

Significance Level $\alpha$ is given as .01
.0404 is greater than .01 so we should retain the null hypothesis

##### Question 3
Is the mean height for all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21 now over 6 feet? Let $\mu$ represent the population mean height of all adult American males between the ages of 18 and 21. What are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?
- [ ] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu < 6$
- [ ] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu \neq 6$
- [x] $H_0:\mu = 6$ vs $H_a:\mu > 6$

because it is asking if the mean is over 6ft

##### Question 4
It is known that driving can be difficult in regions where winter conditions involve snow-covered roads. For cars equipped with all-season tires traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, the mean stopping time in fresh snow is known to be 215 meters, with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.5$ meters. It is often claimed that automobiles in such areas should be equipped with special tires to compensate for such conditions, especially with respect to stopping distance. A manufacturer of tires made for driving in fresh snow claims that vehicles equipped with its tires have a decreased stopping distance. A study was done using a random sample of nine snow tires from the manufacturer on a snow-covered test track. The tests resulted in a mean stopping distance of $\bar x$ = 212.9 meters. Using the sample results, and assuming that stopping distance is a Normally distributed random variable, what is the value of the test statistic?
- [ ] 0.05
- [x] -2.52
- [ ] -9.36
- [ ] -1.04
- [ ] -1.96

Given:
$\mu = 215$
$\bar x = 212.9$
$\sigma = 2.5$
$n = 9$

Test Statistic:
$$ z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}} = \frac{212.9-215}{\frac{2.5}{\sqrt{9}}} = -2.52 $$
##### Question 5
Assume the red areas in the figures represent the P-values calculated from a data set. Which figure has the larger P-value?
![[Pasted image 20221108210956.png]]
- [ ] Figure 1
![[Pasted image 20221108211024.png]]
- [x] Figure 2
- [ ] Both have approximately the same P-Value

Figure B has Larger Area therefore larger probability therefore larger P-Value

##### Question 6
Confidence intervals are resistant to outliers in the data set.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

##### Question 7
A study was conducted on the reaction time of female subjects over the age of 50 to a particular light stimulus using a specific type of red light. A random sample of 45 female subjects from this age group in the population was selected, and the subjectsâ€™ reaction times (in seconds) were determined. Based on the test data, the 99% confidence interval estimate for $\mu$ was determined to be (0.66, 0.78). From this interval we can conclude that
- [ ] this interval contains the sample mean with probability 0.99.
- [ ] this interval has a probability of 0.99 of enclosing the true mean $\mu$
- [ ] in the long run, this interval will contain the true mean $\mu$ 99% of the time.
- [x] we have 99% confidence in this interval, because in repeated sampling from the population, the method used to determine such confidence intervals will produce intervals 99% of which will contain $\mu$
- [ ] we have 99% confidence that this interval contains $\mu$ , because if we repeated testing over and over again, 99% of the time this interval would contain $\mu$

##### Question 8
Practical significance will always lead to statistical significance
- [ ] true
- [x] false

##### Question 10
Researchers are studying the yield of a crop in two locations. The researchers are going to compute independent 90% confidence intervals for the mean yield at each location. What is the probability that at least one of the intervals will cover the true mean yields at their location?
- [ ] 0.81
- [ ] 0.19
- [x] 0.99
- [ ] 0.95

Probability that interval for field A contains $\mu$ or that intervale for field B contains $\mu$
$$ P(A\; or\; B) $$
$$ P(A) = .9\qquad P(B) = .9 $$
$$ P(A\; or\; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\; and \; B) $$
$$ = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) $$
$$ = .9 + .9 - .9^2 = 1.8 - .081 = .99 $$
