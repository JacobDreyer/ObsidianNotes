#### [[Set]] Operations
##### Union
$$ S = \{1,2,3\}\qquad T = \{2,3,4\} $$
$$ S\cup T = \{1,2,3,4\} $$
Collection of Objects in either S or T

##### Intersection
$$ S\cap T = \{2,3\} $$
Collection of Objects in both S and T

##### Set Difference
$$ S-T = \{1\} $$
Elements in S that are not in T

##### Symmetric Difference
$$ S\oplus T = \{1,4\} $$
Elements in S or T but not Both

##### Complement
$$ S = \{1,2,3\}\qquad U = \mathbb N $$
$$ S\subseteq  U $$
$$  = \{0,4,5,6,7,\cdots\}  $$
Complement of S in U is elements of U not in S
$\mathbb N$ = All Natural Numbers

##### Notation
Given a List of Sets: $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n$
$$ \cup^n_{i=1}S_i = S_1\cup S_2\cup\cdots\cup S_n $$
