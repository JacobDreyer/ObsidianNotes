- You have a function 
	- Think a hill over the x,y plane
- A [[Level Curve]] will be the line for which $f(x,y) = c$ (think a contour line on a hill)
- At any point $P(x_0, y_0)$ on the level curve, $\nabla f(x_0, y_0)$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector to the level curve at that point

- Now suppose you have a function with 3 variables
- Now you have a level surface
- $F(x,y,z) = c$         (think layer of an onion)
- $\nabla F$ is normal (perpindicular) to the level surface at P
