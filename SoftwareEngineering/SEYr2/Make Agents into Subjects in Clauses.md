#### Find Agents (Characters)
Make sure that the grammatical subjects are the agents (or doers) of the action.

Ex. A "result" of the engineering team's "agreement" for the "reduction" of "nominalizations" was clearer "communication".

The engineering team "agreed" to "reduce" nominalizations, which "resulted" in clearer "communication"

Identify Actions: 4 [[Nominalization]]s - these are actions that require agents.

Identify potential agents: Who are the agents / characters in this sentence


Characters in non-action-oriented constructions tend to be hidden.

Look for [[Possesive Pronouns]] or [[Adjective]]s preceding [[Nominalization]]s (ex: his recommendation, parental supervision), objects of [[Prepositions]] (ex. of the engineering team), or in [[Passive Voice]] constructions missing or implied [[Subject]]s
