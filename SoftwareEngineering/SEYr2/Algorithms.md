title: Definition

An odrered sequence of well-defined finite instructions that given an initial state, performs some task nd halts in finite time.

- Algorithm offers clear start and end points for the system/task
- Algorithms are written in the design phase of the [[Software Development Cycle]]

## Means of Writing Algorithms
Algorithms can be illustrated by one of the following Ways
- [[Pseudo-Code]]
	- Kind of structured English that describes all the necessary steps in the task
- Flow Charts, [[UML Diagram]]s
	- provide graphical representation of all the possible steps in a task
- Natural Language
	- Normal Talking

## Algorithm Representation
Representations for Algorithms are generally grouped into three levels:
- High-Level description (almost like natural language)
	- Describes an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details
- Implementation Description
	- Defines the algorithm in a way the system inputs data, process data and output data. At this level we do not give details of states or transition functionalities
- Formal Description
	- Most detailed description is provided in this level that include logical expressions and certain well-accepted rules. This is the lowest level in algorithm representation

## Algorithm Classifications
- Classification by Design Concept
	- [[Divide and Conquer Algorithm]]
	- [[Dynamic Programming]]
	- [[The Greedy Algorithm]]
		- Concept behind these 3 are very similar
	- [[Linear Programming]]
	- [[Reduction]]
	- [[Search and Enumeration]]
		- Ex. Brute Force
	- [[The Probalistic and Heuristic Paradigm]]
		- AKA Interactable Algorithm
- Classification by Implementation
	- Recursion or Iteration
	- Logical
	- Serial or Parallel or Distributed
	- Deterministic or Non-Deterministic
	- Exact or Approximate
- Classification by field of study
	- Search Algorithms 
	- Sorting Algorithms
	- Merge Algorithms
	- Numerical Algorithms
		- Calculate sinx or cosx
	- Graph Algorithms
	- String Algorithms
	- Computational geometric Algorithms
	- Combinatorial algorithms
	- Machine Learning, Cryptography, Data Compression Algorithms and 
	- Parsing Techniques
