A cycle is a [[Path]] with starting and ending vertex $v_1$ and no repeated edges

##### [[Simple Cycle]]:
Is a cycle where no vertex is repeated

##### [[Euler Cycle]]:
A cycle that contains all edges and vertices

If G has a vertex of odd degree there is no euler cycle

##### [[Hamiltonian Cycle]]
A cycle where every vertex appears once and only once
