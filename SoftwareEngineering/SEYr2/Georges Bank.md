In [[1977]], the federal government claimed its right to manage [[Fisheries]] within a 200 nautical mile zone off [[Canada's East Coast]]; the [[US]] federal government did the same for the [[US East Coast]]

This resulted in an area of dispute between the two countries involving the rights to [[Georges Bank]]

A decision by [[The International Court]] awarded 5/6 of [[Georges Bank]] to the [[US]]

The 1/6 that belongs to [[Canada]] is very rich in [[Scallops]] and has benefitted the [[Nova Scotia Economy]]
