- A summing amplifier is an [[Operational Amplifier]] circuit that combines several inputs and produces an output that is the weighted sum of the inputs

$$ i_1 = \frac{v_1 - v_-}{R_1} $$
$$ i_2 = \frac{v_2 - v_-}{R_2} $$
$$ i_3 = \frac{v_3 - v_-}{R_3} $$
$$ i = \frac{v_- - v_o}{R_f} $$
$$ i_- = 0 $$
$$ v_o = -(\frac{R_f}{R_1}v_1 + \frac{R_f}{R_2}v_2 + \frac{R_f}{R_3}v_3) $$
- The ouput [[Voltage]] $v_o$ is a weighted sum of the inputs
- For this reason, the circuit is called a SUMMER
- It is noted that the summer, in general, can have more than three inputs
