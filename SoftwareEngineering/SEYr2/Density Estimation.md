## Density Estimation
- a [[Density Curves]] gives a compact summary of the overall shape or a distribution
- Many distributions do not have the normal shape
- A density estimator does not start with any specific shape, such as the Normal shape. It looks at the data and draws a density curve that describes the overall shape of the date
- Modern software can be used to produce such curves
