- Suppose that the [[Sequence Diagram]] contains an interaction that we want to resuse elsewhere. Or in the sequence diagram we need to show loops or alternative flows
- This is what a sequence fragment will be used for
- A sequence fragment is represented as a box tht encloses a portion of the interactions within a sequence diagram.
- A fragment box can contain any number of interactions and can contain nested fragments as well
- The top left corner of the fragment box contains an operator. The fragment operator indicates the type of fragment
