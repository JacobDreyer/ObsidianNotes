## Proofs
A proof is an argument that establishes the truth of some statement

#### Direct Proof

#### Proof by Contradiction

#### Proof by Contrapositive
Assume the negation of the conclusion and work towards the negation of the hypothesis.

Works well with things like irrational numbers which are hard to represent whereas the opposite (rational numbers) are easy to represent

Prove: $\phi \to \psi$ 
Assume:
$\neg \psi$ 
Show:
$\neg \phi$

Ex. if 7x+9 is even then x is odd

if x is even then 7x+9 is odd
7x is even
even + odd = odd

#### Proof by Cases
![[Proof by Cases]]

#### [[Proof by Induction]]
Have to have some sort of case/formula where (not exactly just similar):
$$ f(n+1) = r^{n+1} + f(n) $$

base case: 1st thing is true
inductive hypothesis: Assume is true n $\leq$ k
Show k + 1 is true

Therefore every n is true
