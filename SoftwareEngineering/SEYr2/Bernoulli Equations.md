## Bernoulli Equations
$$ \frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y = Q(x)y^n $$
n = integer $\geq$ 0

if n $\geq$ 2 use sub:
$$ v = y^{1-n} $$
$$ \rho = e^{\int P_1(x)dx} $$
$$ v(x) = \frac1{\rho(x)}\int\rho(x)Q_1(x)dx $$
$(1-n)P(x)$ = $P_1(x)$
$(1-n)Q(x)$ = $Q_1(x)$

Basically a [[Linear 1st Order ODE]] but y is subbed out. $(1-n)P(x)$ = $P_1(x)$ is a good way to check answers (or just do maybe)
