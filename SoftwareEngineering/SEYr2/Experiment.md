When our goal is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing data.

#### Observational Study
observes individuals and measures variables of interest but does not attempt to influence the responses. The purpose is to describe some group or situation

#### Experiment
Deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their responses. The purpose is to study whether the treatment causes a change in response.

A study where we do something to people, animals, or objects (the [[Experimental Unit]]) to obsreve the response

![[Confounding]]

![[Experimental Unit]]

##### Factors:
- [[Explanatory Variables]]

##### [[Treatment]]
- A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment
- If an experiment has several [[Explanatory Variables]], a treatment is a combination of specific values of these variables

##### Outcomes
- The measured variables that are used to compare the treatments

#### Comparative Experiments
Subjects are assigned to one of two or more groups. In many studies, two such groups are the control group and the treatment group.

A study is ==biased== if it systematically favours certain outcomes

![[The Placebo Effect]]

#### Need for Randomization
The remedy for [[Confounding]] is to perform a [[Comparative Experiment]] in which some units receive one treatment and similar units receive another. Most well-designed experiments compare two or more [[Treatment]]s

Comparison alone is not enough if the treatments are given to groups that differ greatly, [[Bias]] will result. The solution to the problem of bias is ==random assignment==

```ad-tldr
title: Definition:    Random Assignment
Means that [[Experimental Unit]]s are assigned to treatments at random - that is, using some sort of chance process
```

#### How to Randomize
One way to randomize is rely on random digits.

##### How to Randomly Choose n Individuals from a Group of N
- First, label each of the N individuals with a number
- Randomly select 1 number
- Randomly select 1 number from the remainding numbers
- Continue until you have your n numbers

#### [[Principles of Experimental Design]]
1. Control for [[Lurking Variables]] that might affect the response, most simply by comparing two or more [[Treatment]]s
2. Randomize: Use chance to assign [[Experimental Unit]]s to [[Treatment]]s
3. Replication: Use enough [[Experimental Unit]]s in each group to reduce chance of variation in the results

```ad-summary
In principle, experiments can give good evidence for [[Causation]]

We follow the [[Principles of Experimental Design]] above to ensure that the only reasonable explanation for differences observed is that they were due to the treatment imposed
