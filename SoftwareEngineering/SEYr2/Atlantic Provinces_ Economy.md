### Unemployment
Unemployment rates in the [[Atlantic Provinces]] have frequently been the highest in [[Canada]] and there is heavy dependence on the federal government for economix support

What are the reasons for the weak economic performance of the region?
1. The division into four smaller provinces discourages an integrated economy
2. Some of the natural resources have been nearly exhausted ([[Coal]]) or exploited ([[Cod]])
3. The population is widely dispersed and consists of small cities, towns, and isolated villages
4. It is geographically isolated from political power and is represented by only 32 of the 338 seats in the [[House of Commons]]

Unemployment is especially high in the rural and coastal villages

Many of these communities have their roots in the fishing industry which can no longer support them

Some former fishers turned to commuting to the [[Alberta]] [[Oil Sands]]

Workers spend 20 consecutive days in [[Fort McMurray]] and then return to the [[Atlantic Provinces]] for 8 days
