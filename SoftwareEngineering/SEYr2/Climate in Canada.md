Weather refers to the current state of the atmosphere.

[[Climate]] describes average weather conditions for a specific place over a long period of time

There are two major components of climate:
- [[Temperature]]
- [[Precipitation]]

These components vary greatly across the country as a result of 7 major climatic controls:
- [[Latitude]]
	- At lower latitudes more solar radiation impacts the surface
- [[Altitude]]
	- Higher elevations experience cooler temperatures
- [[Proximity to Bodies of Water]]
	- Water keeps nearby land areas warmer in autumn and cooler in spring
- [[Ocean Currents]]
	- Currents transport warm or cold water depending on the source of the current
- [[Variations in Topography]]
	- Cold air is dense and tends to sink into valleys
- [[Prevailing Wind]]
	- Some wind systems cause rapid temperature changes ([[Chinook Wind]])
- [[Locations of Pressure Systems]]
	- Relates to the position of warm and cold fronts
