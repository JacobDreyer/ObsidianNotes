- In sinusoidal circuit analysis, we find voltages and currents in a circuit with constant frequency source
- If we let amplitude of a sinusoidal source remain constant and vary the frequency, we obtain the circuit frequency response
- The frequency response may be regarded as complete description of the sinusoidal steady-state behaviour of a circuit as a function of frequency
- The frequency response of a circuit is the variation in it's behaviour with change in signal frequency
- The sinusoidal-steady-state frequency responses of circuits are of significance in many applications: [[Communications and Control Systems]]
	- Filters that block out or eliminate signals with unwanted frequencies and pass signals of the desired frequencies
	- Filters are used in radio, TV, and telephone systems to seperate one broadcast frequency from another
