- SMR's are smaller and therefore cheaper to build
- They will be able to be built in a factory and shipped to where they are needed
- the first SMR units are in operation in Russia and China

- SMRs can be linked with other energy sources, including renewables and fossil fuels, to increase grid stability and security

- Talking about money, for about $3 billion, NuScale would install multiple 12 MW SMRs to build a 720 MW nuclear power plant. That’s about 20% cheaper per-megawatt than the $14 billion quoted for two traditional 1.25GW units currently being installed near Waynesboro, Georgia. And that construction has been hit by delays and a ballooning cost up to $28 billion

	- Components will become radioactive. The amount of material at shutdown will be comparable to a fission reactor
		- however half-lives are shorter
			- high level radioactive stuff will be radioactive for 50 years (vs thousands for fission)
			- other low level radiation would be 100 or so years

	- The reactor could explode yet would be similar to other industrial accidents and could be contained within a containment building
	- In the case of an accident where hydrogen ignites (hydrogen is used to convert stray neutrons into tritium) the tritium fragment that enters the atmosphere would be radioactive yet would be such a small amount that it would dilute to legally acceptable limits by the perimeter fence

	- Tritium stuff:
		- Short half-life (12.32 years)
		- does not bio-accumulate (cycles out of the body as water with a biological half-life of 7 to 14 days)
		- It is difficult to contain completely
- Issues:
	- Neutrons released during reaction degrade materials within reaction chamber
- Types:
	- Tokamak
	- Intertial Confinement by laser
	- Magnetized target fusion
	- inertial electrostatic confinement
