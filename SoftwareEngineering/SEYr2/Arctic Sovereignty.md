National boundaries have yet to be determined in much of the [[Arctic Ocean Basin]]

There is an increased urgency for [[Canada]] to acquire territory and delcare soveriegnty of it

Why?
- Pressure from [[Russia]] staking claim of arctic areas
- vast quantities of [[Oil]] lie beneath the [[Arctic Sea Floor]]
- [[Climate Change]] may turn the area into a commercial shipping route

Each country bordering the [[The Arctic Ocean]] has made a claim to a portion of the ocean beyond the 200 nautical mile line of their current control

Some claims have resulted in overlaps which still must be resolved (including claims to [[The North Pole]])

[[The International Seabed]] is too deep for claims as it lies beneath over 2500 meters of water

It is agreed in the international community that [[Canada]] owns the islands of the [[Arctic Archipelago]]

The ownership of the waterways between these islands is in dispute

The [[US]] considers [[The Northwest Passage]] an [[International Sea Route]]

In [[1988]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[US]] President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed [[The Arctic Cooperation Agreement]]

[[The Arctic Cooperation Agreement]]: 
The [[US]] is to always notify [[Canada]] before sending ships through [[The Northwest Passage]]. [[Canada]] is to always give consent. This is pretty much a courtesy agreement. This formal agreement is only between [[Canada]] and the [[US]] and has not been made with any other countries

[[Canada]] is concerned about the impacts of [[Oil Spill]] from tankers traversing [[The Northwest Passage]]

[[1985]]: [[Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act]]
This act passed by [[Canada]]'s parliament gives [[Canada]] the right to control shipping navigation within it's 200 nautical mile economic control area

[[2003]]: [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]
Coastal countries have the right to control shipping navigation within 12 nautical miles
Some of the islands in the [[Arctic Archipelago]] are seperated by more than 50 nautical miles of water
