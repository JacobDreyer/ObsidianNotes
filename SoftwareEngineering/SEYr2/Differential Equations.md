## Differential Equations
```ad-tldr
title: Definition:    Differential Equations

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and it's derivatives
```
$$ y(x) + y'(x) + y''(x) + y'''(x) = \cos(e^x) $$
#### 2 Types
[[Ordinary Differential Equation]] -> ODE                This is the one we deal with

[[Partial Differential Equation]] -> PDE

ODE: All [[Derivative]] are with respect to a single [[Independent Variable]]

PDE: Derivatives are with respect to more than 1 variable

```ad-tldr
title: Definition:    Order

The order of a DE is given by the highest derivation of the unknown function in the equation
```

#### Linear DE vs Non-Linear DE
a Function is a linear DE if the unknown function and its derivatives is raised to the first power and the unknown functions are not multiplied by each other.

#### Solutions
```ad-tldr
title: Definition

A solution of a DE is a function that satisfies the DE
```

A DE may have 1 solution or and infintite many solutions

```ad-tldr
title: Definition

The general solution of a DE is the family or set of all solutions
```

Solution : $y(x) = 6e^x$
General Solution: $y(x) = Ce^x  \quad C\in \mathbb{R}$

Some DE have a special solution called the trivial solution

Trivial Solution: $y(x) = 0$

#### Initial Value Problem
$$IVP = DE + IC$$

IC = Initial Condition

Often the Initial Condition selects from the general solution of the DE a single particular solution

This is called a well posed IVP.
