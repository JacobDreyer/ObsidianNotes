![[Pasted image 20220920133851.png]]
the area under the smooth curve to the left of 6.0 is shaded. If the scale is adjusted so the total area is 1 then this curve is called a density curve.

```ad-tldr
title: Definition

- is always on or above the horizontal axis
- has an area of exactly 1 under it
- describes the overall pattern of a distribution
```

- The [[Mean]] and [[Standard Deviation]] computed from actual observations are denoted by $\bar x$ and $s$ respectively
- The mean and standard deviation of the distribution represented by the density curveare denoted by $\mu$ and $\sigma$
