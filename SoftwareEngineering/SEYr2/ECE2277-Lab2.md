#### Deliverables:
1. Derive a Boolean expression to detect when a 4-bit code does not correspond to a valid BCD value
2. Design a circuit in [[Quartus]] to implement this expression, and also display the 4-bit code on a 7SD
3. Program this Circuit onto the DE10-Standard FPGA development board
4. Demonstrate the correctness of your design to the TA by toggling switchesand observing what is displayed on the FPGA board
