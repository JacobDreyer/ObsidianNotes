### Three Types
1. Occupied
	- The Location references an entry in the dictionaru
2. Empty
	- The location contains null and always has
	- The search will stop the moment it encounters null
		- this is because if null is encountered it means you reached the end of the list at that location
1. Availible
	- The Location's entry was removed from the dictionary
	- The search will go past this point if the expected entry is not found in any availible location
