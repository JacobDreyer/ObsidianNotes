### 1.
Show that the given line integral is independent of path. Evaluate in two ways: (a) find a potential function $\phi$ and (b) use any convenient path between the endpoints of the path
$$ \int_{(0,0)}^{(2,2)}x^2dx + y^2 dy $$
It is a conservative field / independent of path if:
$$ F = P(x,y)\hat i + Q(x,y)\hat j $$
$$ F = x^2\hat i + y^2\hat j $$
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} $$
$$ 0 = 0 $$
$\therefore$ conservative field
$$ \phi = \int x^2dx + \int y^2dy $$
$$ = \frac13x^3 + \frac13y^3 $$
$$ \int_{(0,0)}^{(2,2)}x^2dx + y^2dy = \phi(2,2) - \phi(0,0) $$
$$ = (\frac83 + \frac83) - (0 + 0) $$
$$ = \frac{16}3 $$
==This approach is technically wrong. It works here because is essentially skips the first couple steps. To see full, proper way see Q3==

We won't solve the other way here. It is just normal [[Line Integration]]. See [[NMM2276.9.8]] for examples

Show that the given line integral is independent of path. Evaluate in two ways: (a) find a potential function $\phi$ and (b) use any convenient path between the endpoints of the path
$$ \int_{(0,0)}^{(2,2)}(x+2y)dx + (2x-y)dy $$
$$ 2 = 2 $$
$\therefore$ conservative
$$ \phi = \int_0^x \phi_1(t,0)dt + \int_0^y\phi_2(x,t)dt $$
$$ = \int_0^x(t + 2(0)) + \int_0^y(2x-t)dt $$
$$ = \int_0^x tdt + \int_0^y(2x-t)dt $$
$$ = \frac{t^2}2|_0^x + (2xt - \frac{t^2}2)|_0^y $$
$$ = \frac{x^2}2 + 2xy - \frac{y^2}2 $$
$$ \int_{(1,0)}^{(3,2)}(x+2y)dx + (2x-y)dy = \phi(3,2) - \phi(1,0) $$
$$ = ((3^2)/2 + 2(3)(2) - (2^2)/2) - (\frac12 + 0 + 0) $$
$$ = \frac92 + 12- 2 - \frac12 $$
$$ = 14 $$
