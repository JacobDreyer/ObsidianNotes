## Correlation
The correlation r

The correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables
$$ r = \frac1{n-1}\sum(\frac{x_i-\bar x}{s_x})(\frac{y_i-\bar y}{s_y}) $$
- $n$ = 
- $\bar x, \bar y$ = [[Mean]]
- $s_x,s_y$ = [[Standard Deviation]]
- $r$ = correlation

#### Measuring Linear Association
- A linear relationship is strong if the points lie close to a straight line and weak if they are widely scattered about a line

#### Properties of Correlation
- r is always a number between -1 and 1, inclusive
- r > 0 indicates a positive association (goes up)
- r < 0 indicates a negative association (gooes down)
- Values of r near 0 indicate a very weak linear relationship
- The strength of the linear relationship increases as r moves awayfrom 0 toward -1 or 1
- The extreme values of r=-1 and r=1occur only in the case of a perfect linear relationship

1. Correlation makes no distinction between explanatory and response variables
2. $r$ has no units and does not change when we change the units of measurement of x,y, or both
##### Cautions
- Correlation requires that both variables be quantitative
- Correlation does not describe curved relationships between variables, no matter how strong the relationship is
- The correlation r can be strongly affected by a few outlying observations
- Correlation is not a complete summary of two-variable data
