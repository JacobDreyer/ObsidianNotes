A probability model describes the possible outcomes of a chance process and the likelihood that those outcomes will occur

A random variable takes numerical values that describe the outcomes of some chance process

The probability distribution of a random variable gives its possible values and their probabilities

### The [[Mean]] of a Random Variable
When analyzing discrete random variables, we will follow the same strategy we used with quantitative data - describe the shape, centre, and spread, and identify any outliers

The mean of a discrete random variable is the average of the possible outcomes, with each outcome weighted by its probability.
$$ \mu_x = \sum x_i\;p_i $$
### [[Variance]] of a Random Variable
$$ \sigma_X^2 = \sum(x_i-\mu_X)^2p_i $$
$\mu_X$ = [[Mean]] of a random variable
to get the [[Standard Deviation]] of a [[Random Variables]], take the square root of the variance
