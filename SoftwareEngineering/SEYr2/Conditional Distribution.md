## Conditional Distribution
- To examine relationships between 2 variables we need to explore conditional distributions of the variables
- A Conditional Distribution of a variable describes the values of that variable among individuals who have a specific value of another variable

#### To Examine:
1. Select Rows or Columns of interest (Of [[Two-Way Table]])
2. Use the data in the table to calculate the conditional distribution (in percent) of the rows or columns
3. Make a graph to display the conditional distribution
	- Use a [[Side-by-Side Bar Graph]] or a [[Segmented Bar Graph]]

|                  | Female | Male | Total |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| Almost no Chance | 96     | 98   | 194   |
| Some chance      | 426    | 286  | 712   |
| A 50-50 Chance   | 696    | 720  | 1416  |
| A good Chance    | 663    | 758  | 1421  |
| Almost Certain   | 486    | 597  | 1083  |
| Total            | 2367   | 2459 | 4826  |

| Response         | Male             | Female           |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Almost No Chance | 98/2459 = 4%     | 96/2367 = 4.1%   |
| Some Chance      | 286/2459 = 11.6% | 426/2367 = 18.0% |
| A 50-50 Chance   | 29.3%            | 29.4%            |
| A Good Chance    | 30.8%            | 28.0%            |
| Almost Certain   | 24.3%            | 20.5%            |
