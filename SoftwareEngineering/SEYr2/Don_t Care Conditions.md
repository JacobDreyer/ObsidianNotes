A don't care condition is a specific set of input values, at which it doesn't matter whether a boolean function should be a 1 or a zero

These are usually defined in SOP form as $d =\sum(\cdots)$ where a set of minterms are given

When simplifying the function using [[K-Maps]], don't care conditions can be considered as a 1 or 0
