- A highpass filter is formed when the output of an [[RC Circuit]] is taken off the resistor

- The [[Transfer Function]] is given by:
$$ H(\omega) = \frac{V_0}{V_i} = \frac{j\omega RC}{1+j\omega RC} $$
- The cutoff frequency is given by:
$$ \omega_c = \frac1{RC} $$

- a highpass filter is designed to pass all frequencies above it's [[Cutoff Frequency]] $\omega_c$
- a highpass filter can also be formed when the output of an [[RL Circuit]] is taken off the [[Inductance]]
