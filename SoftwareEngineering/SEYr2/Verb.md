If nouns provide the subject and object of a sentence, (i.e the what and who) verbs provide the crucial information of ==what== the subject and objects are doing

A verb is an action word which asserts something about the subject of the sentence and expresses actions, events, or states or being. It is the [[predicate]] portion of a sentence, that is, it supplies information or tells us something about the subject

Verbs are simple actions like:
swim, think, act, run, jump, hike, sit, sleep, etc.
but also express or describe states of being like:
be, feel, or seem
