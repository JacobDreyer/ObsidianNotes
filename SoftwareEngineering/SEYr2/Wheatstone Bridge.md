A circuit used to measure unknown resistances

The cicuit consists of a DC voltage source $v_s$, a detector, the unkown resistance $R_x$ and three precision resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$

$R_2$ and $R_3$ are adjustable resistances

Detector is capable of responding to small currents, has a pointer that deflects one way or another depending on the direction of the current

Operation: Resistances $R_3$ and $R_2$ are adjusted in value until the detector indicates 0 current. This is called balanced condition

at balance $i_1 = i_3$ and $i_2 = i_4$

$$ R_x = \frac{R_2}{R_1}R_3 $$
