### Parameters
None

### Why is it Usefull?
Specifies the interactions contained within the [[Sequence Fragment]] must occur exactly as they are indicated; otherwise, the fragment is declared invalid and an exception is raised. Works in a similar fashion to the assert statement in [[Java]]. Usefull when specifying that every step in an interaction must occur successfully. i.e. when modeling a transaction
