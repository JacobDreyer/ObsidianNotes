The National Policy (1879) contributed to the development of the [[Geographic Core]] in Canada.

This policy created a nation-wide market for Canadian-made goods

How?
- Through the implementation of tariffs and restriction of trade on foriegn-made goods

The Policy had several implications:
- It increased the price of goods from the US which would have otherwise been cheaper to purchase
- It favoured economic and manufacturing growth in southern Ontario and southern Quebec since this is where transportation costs were minimized
- It had a negative impact in Western Canada because they were purchasing expensive Canadian made goods from the core but were exporting wheat and grain to the US at low prices since the US had its own tariffs
