## Stemplots
To Construct a stemplot:
- Seperate each observation into a stem(all but rightmost digit) and a leaf(the remaining digit)
- Write the stems in a vertical column; draw a vertical line to the right of the stems
- write each leaf in a row to the right of the stem; order the leaves , if desired
- If there are very few stems then you might want to create more stems by splitting the original stems
