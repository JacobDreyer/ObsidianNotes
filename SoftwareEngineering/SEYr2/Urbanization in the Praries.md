### [[Gateway City]]
Some cities in the [[Central Praries]] act as collection and distribution points between the city and the [[Hinterland]] to their north

The size of the gateway city often reflects the economic strength and extent of the [[Hinterland]]

Examples:
[[Edmonton]] -> [[Northern Alberta]] Hinterland
[[Prince Albert]] -> [[Northern Saskatchewan]] Hinterland
[[Thompson]] -> [[Northen Manitoba]] Hinterland

The smaller size of [[Prince Albert]] and [[Thompson]] indicates lower economic strength in their hinterlands
