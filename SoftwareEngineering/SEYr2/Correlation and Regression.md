## [[Correlation]] and [[Regression]]
#### Caution
- Both describe linear relationships
- Both are affected by outliers
- Always plot the data before interpreting
- Beware of extrapolation
	- Use caution in predicting y when x is outside the range of observed x's
- Beware of lurking variables
	- These have an important effect on the relationship among the variables in a study but are not included in the study
- Correlation does not imply causation
