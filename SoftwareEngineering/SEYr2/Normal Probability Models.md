Often, the [[Density Curves]] used to assign probabilities to intervals of outcomes is the [[Normal Curves]]

==Normal distributions are probability models==
Probabilities can be assigned to intervals of outcomes using the standard normal probabilities

We standardize Normal data by calulating [[Z-Score]]s so that any Normal Curve can be transformed into the [[Standard Normal Curve]]
