the grad operator gives us the components of the spatial rate of change of F along each cartesian direction

$$ (\nabla F)_x = (\nabla\vec F)\cdot\hat i = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} $$
more generally if we wanted to know the spatial rate of change of F along some arbitrary direction defined by a unit vector $\hat u$, we simply calculate [[The Dot Product]] of $\nabla F$ onto $\hat u$:
$$ D_{\hat u}F(x,y,z) = \nabla F\cdot\hat u $$
- $D_{\hat u}$ = Directional derivative of F along $\hat u$

In what direction is the directional derivative the largest?
$$ D_uF(x,y,z) = \nabla F\cdot\hat u $$
Magnitude of 
$$D_u F(x,y,z) = |\nabla F||\hat u|\cos\phi = |\nabla F|\cos\phi $$
- $\phi$ = angle between $\nabla F$ and $\hat u$

So the gradient vector $\nabla\vec F$ points in the direction along which F increases most rapidly

F is a scalar function
$\nabla F$ is a vector function
