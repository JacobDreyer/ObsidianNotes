- A phasor is a [[Complex Number]] that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid
- A complex number $z$ can be written as:
$$ z = x+jy $$
- Where:
$$ j = \sqrt{-1} $$
- x is the real part of z and y is the imaginary part of z
- The complex number $z$ can also be written in polar form as:
$$ z = r\angle\phi $$
- It can also be written in the exponential form as:
$$ z = re^{j\phi} $$
- Where:
$$ r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} $$
$$ \phi = \tan^{-1}(\frac yx) $$
- Thus $z$ may be written as
$$ z = r(\cos\phi + j\sin\phi) $$
- Given the complex numbers:
$$ z_1 = x_1+jy_1 = r_1\angle\phi_1 $$
$$ z_2 = x_2 + jy_2 = r_2\angle\phi_2 $$
- Addition/Subtraction:
$$ z_1 \pm z_2 = (x_1 \pm x_2)+j(y_1\pm y_2) $$
- Multiplication:
$$ z_1z_2 = r_1r_2\angle(\phi_1+\phi_2) $$
- Division:
$$ \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\angle(\phi_1-\phi_2) $$
- Reciprocal:
$$ \frac1{z_1} = \frac1{r_1}\angle-\phi_1 $$
- Square Root:
$$ \sqrt{z_1} = \sqrt{r_1}\angle\phi/2 $$
- Complex Conjugate:
$$ z_1^* = x_1-jy_1 = r_1\angle-\phi_1 = r_1 $$
