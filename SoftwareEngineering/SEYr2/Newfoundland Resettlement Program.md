This was a joint venture between the federal and [[Newfoundland]] governments from [[1967]] to [[1975]]

Residents of tiny villages were encouraged to relocate to one of 77 "growth centres"

If at least 75% of the residents in a village agreed, they received money to pay for moving expenses

Over 150 villages were abandoned under this program

A form of this program is still in place today but now requires 90% of residents to agree to vacate
