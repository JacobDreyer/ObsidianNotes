- In electric circuit analysis, the phase relationships between currents and voltages are very important. To see this, consider two voltages:
$$ v_1(t) = 3\cos(\omega t+40^o) $$
$$ v_2(t) = 4\cos(\omega t-20^o) $$
- The corresponding [[Phasor]]s are given by:
$$ \boldsymbol V_1 = 3\angle40^o $$
$$ \boldsymbol V_2 = 4\angle-20^o $$

- The angle between $\boldsymbol V_1$ and $\boldsymbol V_2$ is $60^o$
- Because the vectors rotate CCW, we say that $\boldsymbol V_1$ leads $\boldsymbol V_2$ by $60^o$
- Alternatively $V_1$ lags $V_2$ by $60^o$
- Consider two sinusoids:
$$ v_1(t) = V_m\sin(\omega t) $$
$$ v_2(t) = V_m\sin(\omega t+\phi) $$

- The starting point of $v_2(t)$ in the figure occurs first in time. Therefore, we say $v_2(t)$ leads $v_1(t)$ by $\phi$
- If $\phi = 0$ we say $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ are in phase (they reach maxima and minima at the same time)
- We can compare $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ in this manner because they operate at the same frequency (They do not need to have the same magnitude)
