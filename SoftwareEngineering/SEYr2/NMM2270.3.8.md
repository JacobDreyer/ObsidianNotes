1. A mass weighing 4 pounds is attached to a spring whose spring constant is 16 lb/ft. What is the period of simple harmonic motion?
$F_s = -k(x-x_0)$
$F_g = mg$
$F_{net} = ma$
$$ ma = -kx $$
$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0 $$
$$ x'' + \frac{kx}{m} = 0 $$
Convert Weight into mass:
$$ m = 4/32 = 1/8 $$
now sub in
$$ x''+128x = 0 $$
$$ r^2 + 128 = 0 $$
$r = \pm\sqrt{-128} = \pm4\sqrt{8}i = \pm8\sqrt{2}i$
$$ y_c = C_1\cos(8\sqrt2t) + C_2\sin(8\sqrt2t) $$
We know: $y_c = C_1\cos(\omega t) + C_2\sin(\omega t)$
And the Period is $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
$$ T = \frac{2\pi}{8\sqrt2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2} = \frac{\pi\sqrt 2}{8} $$
3. A mass weighing 24 pounds, attached to the end of a spring, stretches it 4 inches. Initially, the mass is released from rest from a point 3 inches above the equilibrium position. Find the equation of motion.

weight to mass: $$ 24/32 = .75 $$
Spring Force:
$$ F = kx $$
wieght F is in ft so 4in becomes 4/12 ft
$$ 24 = k(\frac13) $$
$$ k = 72 $$
$$ ma = -kx $$
$$ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac kmx = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+96x = 0 $$
$$ r^2 + 96 = 0 $$
$r = \pm\sqrt{-96} = \pm4\sqrt6i$
$$ x_c(t) = C_1\cos(4\sqrt6t) + C_2\sin(4\sqrt6t) $$
at t=0 x = -3/12 =-1/4
$$ -\frac14 = C_1 $$
at t=0 x' = 0
$$ x'_c(t) = \frac14\sin(4\sqrt6t)\cdot 4\sqrt 6 + C_2\cos(4\sqrt6t)\cdot4\sqrt6 $$
$$ 0 = C_2\cdot4\sqrt 6 $$
$$ 0 = C_2 $$
$$ x_c(t) = \frac14\cos(4\sqrt6t) $$
5. A mass weighing 20 pounds stretches a spring 6 inches. The mass is initially released from rest from a point 6 inches below the equilibrium position.
	1. Find the position of the mass at times t=$\pi/12, \pi/8, \pi/6, \pi/4,$ and $9\pi/32$
	2. What is the velocity of the mass when t = 3$\pi$/16 s? In which direction is the mass heading at this instant?
	3. At what times does the mass pass through the equilibrium position?
$20/32 = .625$

$F = kx$
$20 = k\frac6{12}$
$30 = k$

$$ = C_1\cos(\omega t) + C_2\sin(\omega t) $$
$\omega = \sqrt{\frac km} = \sqrt{\frac{30}{.625}} = 4\sqrt3$
$$ x_c(t) = C_1\cos(4\sqrt3t) + C_2\sin(4\sqrt3t) $$
$x_c(0) = 6/12 = .5$
$x_c'(0)=0$
$$ .5 = C_1 $$
$$ 0 = C_2(1)(4\sqrt3) $$
$$ 0 = C_2 $$
$$ x_c(t) = -\frac12\cos(8t) $$
this became this because i miscalculated k. its supposed to be 40
#1
$$ x_c(\pi/12) = -\frac14 $$
$$ x_c(\pi/8) = -\frac12 $$
$$ x_c(\pi/4) = \frac12 $$
$$ x_c(9\pi/32) = \frac{\sqrt 2}4 $$
#2
$$ x'(t) = 4\sin(8t) $$
$$ x'(3\pi/16) = 4\sin(3\pi/2) $$
29. A force of 2 pounds stretches a spring 1 foot. A mass weighing 3.2 pounds is attached to the spring, and the system is then immersed in a medium that offers a damping force numerically equal to 0.4 times the instantaneous velocity
$2 = k(1)$
3.2/32 = .1 = m
$$ ma = -kx - .4v $$
$$ x''(t) + \frac kmx + \frac{.4}mx'=0 $$
$$ x''(t) + 4x'+20x = 0 $$
$$ r^2 + 4r +20=0 $$
$$ = \frac{-4\pm\sqrt{16-4(20)}}{2} $$
$$ = -2\pm\frac12\sqrt{64}i $$
$$ x_c(t) = C_1e^{-2t}\cos(4t)+C_2e^{-2t}\sin(4t) $$
