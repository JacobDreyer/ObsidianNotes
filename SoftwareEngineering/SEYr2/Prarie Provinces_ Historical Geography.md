### Surveying the Land
Land surveyors were preparing the land for [[Eastern Europe]]an Settlement in the late [[1860s]]. Due to the lack of topographic obstacles, it was easy to divide the land into a grid system with lots in the size of perfect squares

Each square lot was 1/4 of a square mile in area

The land survey pattern ignored the fact that some of the land was already occupied by [[Indigenous People]]s

The most populous group of [[Indigenous People]]s in the region were the [[Metis]] (Over 12,000 people). They reacted to the surveyors with organized rebellions

Other more semi-nomadic [[Indigenous People]] felt little choice but to sign treaties

Each newcomer family from [[Eastern Europe]] was given one square lot

In many cases they were given the land on which to build a homestead for free, but there was no access to electricity or plumbing.

### Challenges Facing Homesteaders
The grid and square based surey system encouraged a highly dispersed rural population which created a sense of isolation

Many settlers were not prepared for the climate (cold, drought, wind, thunderstorms, hail) and the far distance to any large population centres

Homesteaders were forced to be innovative (e.g practicing [[Summer Fallow]]) for their crop to succeed

### Early Settlement Patterns
Initially, villages and towns were arranged in a linear pattern linked to railroads.

These settlements provided basic services for nearby farmers

Larger towns developed around [[Grain Elevators]]; roughly every third settlement along a railroad was larger and provided more diverse service than villages (e.g. a school or a medical clinic)

Each village was home to frequently used services (e.g. general store)

### Rural Population Decline
Since [[1940]], the rural population in the [[Praries]] has steadily declined

Why?
1. Farms became larger and more mechanized leading to a lower population density
2. Grain farms became more common. There is no livestock on these types of farms thus minimal staffing is needed

### Declining Villages
The population of many villages has also declined

Why?
1. Lower rural population density of rural areas leads to less buisness for villages
2. An increased use of trucks and cars as opposed to railroads. When new roads and highways were built, they tended to bypass small villages
3. Rationalization of road and rail systems

Infrequently used transport corridors were shut down

Fewer villages resulted in reduced need to maintain a dense local transportation network therefore leading to a cycle of change

Decline in villages -> closing local roads and rails
Closing local roads and rails -> decline in villages

### Sites of Growth
While small villages have declined, larger communities have seen growth:
1. [[Dormitory Town]]s (people live in the town but work in a nearby large city)
2. Sites of government sources (provincial capitals)
3. Resource towns
