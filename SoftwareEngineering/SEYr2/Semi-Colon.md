Whereas the [[Comma]] is principally used to set off subordinate or subsidiary elements of a sentence (Iterupters, non-restrictive and introductory elements) and link dependent and main clauses, with the caveat of the coordinating, the semi-colon moves closer to the period

We use the semi-colon to create balanced constructions between two conceptually related main clauses. Think of the semi-colon as strong enough to hold together two [[independent clauses]] that are conceptually related

We use the semi-colon to connect two main clauses in place of a [[coordinating conjunction]]

We also use semi-colons with [[conjunctive adverbs]] and [[transitional phrases]]

I went to the store; "accordingly", I did my chore

I ran to school; "afterward", I had a beer at the grad club.

The key point about semi-colons is to remember that they join or link main/independent clauses in balanced constructions of closely related ideas
