- The [[Transfer Function]] is given by:
$$ H(\omega) = \frac{V_0}{V_i} = -\frac{Z_f}{Z_i} = -\frac{j\omega R_fC_i}{1+j\omega R_iC_i} $$
$$ Z_i = R_i + \frac1{j\omega C_i} $$
$$ Z_f = R_f $$
- The transfer function is similar to the transfer function of [[Highpass Passive Filter]], except that at ver high frequency ($\omega\to\infty$) the gain tends to $-\frac{R_f}{R_i}$.
- The [[Cutoff Frequency]] is given by:
$$ \omega_c = \frac1{C_iR_i} $$
