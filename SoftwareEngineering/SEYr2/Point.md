[[Purpose]] is something we define for ourselves at outset: generalized sense of what we want to do/accomplish (think desired outcome)

Focused articulation of that purpose = Point (think: thesis statement, statement of purpose, articulation of what you are proposing, concise description of what you're analyzing, subject line, ...)

During [[Pre-Drafting]], concern is with streamlining sense of purpose to help us better discern (eventual) point and start thinking about how our message can be tailored to audience

5 Questions to help clarify point from [[Purpose]]:
- What prompted this communication?
	- (Considerations of context/urgency: exigence)
- What do i want to achieve
- What information is needed to help me acheive my desired goal?
- What do i need my audience to take away from my message?
- What do i want them to do (if anything)?
