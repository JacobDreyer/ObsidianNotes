- At [[Resonance]], the [[reactive energy]] in the circuit oscillates between the inductor and capacitor
- The Quality factor relates the maximum or peak energy stored to energy dissipated in the circuit per cycle of oscillation. That is:
$$ Q = 2\pi \frac{Peak\; Energy\;Stored\;in\;the\;circuit}{Energy\;Dissipated\;in\;one\;period\;at\;\omega_o} $$
$$ Q = 2\pi\frac{\frac12LI^2}{\frac12I^2R(\frac1{f_o})} = \frac{\omega_oL}R $$
$$ Q = \frac1{\omega_o CR} $$
- The quality factor is a dimensionless quantity
- Also, the quality factor is related to the [[Bandwidth]] of the [[RLC circuit]]
