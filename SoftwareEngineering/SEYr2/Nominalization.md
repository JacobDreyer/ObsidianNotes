- [[Nominalization]] = "process of transforming an action from a [[Dynamic Verb]] form to a [[Static Noun]] form"
- Nominalizations = [[Abstract Noun]]s derived from [[Verb]]s (and occasionaly [[Adjective]]s)

Common Endings:
- -tion
- -ment
- -ance

Note: nominalizations can also include words that are derived from verbs, but don't have these common endings

### Guidelines
1. Avoid using nominalizations as [[Subject]]sm unless the subject nominalization refers to a previous sentence
2. Nominalizations are also preferable when they are the object of a [[Verb]] (the object that receives the direct action of the verb)
