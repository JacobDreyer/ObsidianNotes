- How will [[Audience]] (likely) receive the message? Positively? Negatively? Neutrally? Will the audience be accepting of the message or resistant to it?
- Is Implementation (of whatever) difficult? is nature/content of message new or unfamiliar?
- Does audience have past (positive/negative) experiences with me or my material or the situation that provides exigence of my message
- is [[Genre]] adapted in an engaging, interesting way to facilitate ease of understanding and address the needs/expectation of the audience

	- (encompasses considerations of [[Purpose]]/[[Point]])
- What (if anything) can i reasonably assume my reader/listener already knows
- What is the best strategy - in terms of [[Genre]], language, organization - to make readers/listeners understand or accept the message (and/or motivate them to act)
