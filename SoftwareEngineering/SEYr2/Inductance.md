Inductance is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition to the change of current flowing through it

The inductance of a [[inductor]] depends on it's physical dimension and construction

With reference to the inductor shown below, its inductance is given by:
$$ L = \frac{N^2\mu A}{l} $$
Where:
- $N$ = # of turns
- $l$ = length
- $A$ = cross sectional area
- $\mu$ = $\mu_0\mu_r$ = the permeability of the core

Inductance can be increased by:
- Increasing the # of turns of coil
- Using material with higher permiability of the core
- increasing the cross-sectional area
- reducing the length of the coil
