## Linked List
- a [[Data Structure]] where the objects are arranged in linear order
	- However instead of the order being determined by indices like [[Arrays]] The order is determined by a pointer in each object
	- consists of nodes
	- No node contains:
		- element
		- link to next node via address
- Can be realized in 2 forms:
	- Singly linked list
