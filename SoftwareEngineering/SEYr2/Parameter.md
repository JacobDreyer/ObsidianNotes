title: Definition

A Parameter is a number that describes some characteristic of the [[Population]]
```

- In statistical practice, the value of a parameter is not known because we cannot examine the entire population

Remember S and P:                                                           
[[Statistic]]s come from [[Sample]]s                                              
and [[Parameter]]s come from [[Population]]s
