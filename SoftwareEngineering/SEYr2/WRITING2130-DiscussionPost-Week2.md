To improve an Automated System a stategy must be developed to minimize the effect failures can have on other systems, determine the impact of failures, and ascertain the severity of the impact. The following points will outline the necessary strategy needed:
- Develop a strategy to control independent works cells and system architecture
- Detemine the impact of a failure in a facility or production area support system or service.
- Ascertain the severity of a failure in a process support system

I don't think that the points need to be rearranged because as they fall they outline the needed process for analyzing failures. That being to minimize their effect, determine what is impacted, and then determining the severity of the effect. In my opinion this is the best process to follow for analyzing failures.

pg 164: Elaborating: Giving enough detail
- Engineers need to use modifiers to elaborate on ideas
- Elaboration is the process of adding detail such that a reader gets the full grasp of what we are saying
- Modifiers are how we gain the precision that we require
