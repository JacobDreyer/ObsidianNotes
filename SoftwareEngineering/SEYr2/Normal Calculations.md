## Normal Calculations
1. Expresss the problem in terms of the observed variable x
2. Draw a picture of the distribution and shade the area of interest under the curve
3. Perform calculations
	1. Standardize x to restate the problem in terms of a standard normal variable z([[Standardized Value]])
	2. Use [[Standard Normal Table]] and the fact that the total area under the curve is 1 to find the required area under the Standard [[Normal Curves]]
4. write conclusion
