There are differences in the type of catch by location: 

[[Newfoundland]] havested mostly [[Cod]] in [[The Grand Banks]] until the collapse of that industry

The [[Maritime Provinces]] harvest a variety of sea life ([[Lobster]], [[Scallops]], [[Shrimp]], [[Flounder]], [[Crab]]) in several different banks

[[Lobster]] is the most valuable species, accounting for over 60% of the total value of the [[Maritime Fishery]]

Modernization has impacted the fishing industry:
- Fewer fishers are required since nets and gear have become more efficient
- Large [[Trawler]]s with weighted nets have contributed to the problem of exploitation

The weighted nets discriminately trap all types of fish regardless of age, species, and value

Implications:
- They create enormous waste because non-commercial fish are discarded
- They destroy fragile ecosystems on the ocean floor, inculding [[Reefs]] and habitats for breeding
