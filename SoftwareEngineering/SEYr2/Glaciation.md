Glaciation was a major shaping force in Canada 

All of Canada (except for northern yukon) was covered by ice sheets just 18,000 years ago

The advance and retreat of ice has greatly altered the appearence of the landscape

Canada has over 2 million lakes (60% of world total). Most of these lakes formed from the melting of a continental glacier

### Evolution of the [[Great Lakes]]
The Great lakes are remnants of glacial lakes that bordered the continental ice sheet.

The bottoms of the lakes were formed by glacial scouring and then filled with water from the melting ice

### Former [[Lake Agassiz]]
Formed by melting ice, this was once the largest lake in North America

It was located mostly in what is now Manitoba

The former lakebed is now flat and fertile farmland as part of the red river valley
