Let A be a [[Set]]

a partition of A is a possibly infinite collection of sets $A_1,A_2,\cdots$ so that

every partition gives an equivalence relation

every equivalence relation gives a partition

1. $A = A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cdots$
2. $A_i\cap A_j = \phi\quad if\quad i\neq j$

$\phi$ = Empty [[Set]]
