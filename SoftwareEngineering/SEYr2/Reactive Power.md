In [[AC Circuit]]s energy flows into and out of energy storing elements (inductances and capacitances)

For example, when the voltage magnitude across a capacitance is increasing, energy flows into it and when the voltage magnitude decreases energy flows out

Similarily energy flows into an inductance when current flowing through it increases in magnitude

Instantaneous power can be very large, the net energy transferred per cycle is zero for either an ideal capacitance or inductance

The peak instantaneous power associated with energy storing elements contained in a general load is called the reactive power (Q) and is given by:

$$ Q = V_{rms}I_{rms}\sin\theta $$
The unit of reactive power is Watts. However, to emphasize the fact that Q does not represent the flow of net energy, its units are usually Volt Ampere Reactive (VAR)
