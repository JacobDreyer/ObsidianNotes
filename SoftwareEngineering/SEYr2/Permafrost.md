Permaforst can be alpine or zonal. There are 3 types of zonal permafrost:
- [[Continous Permafrost]]
	- At least 80% of the ground is permanently frozen
- [[Discontinous Permafrost]]
	- 30-80% of the ground is permanently frozen
- [[Sporadic Permafrost]]
	- Less than 30% of the ground is permanently frozen

Permafrost forms where the mean annual temperature of the soil is below $0^o$ C

[[Discontinous Permafrost]] may form in sloped areas with a northerly aspect

[[Aspect]]: the direction that a slope faces

The line seperating continuous and discontinuous permafrost roughly follows the tree line.

The tree line has moved norhtward by approximately 100km over the past 50 years
