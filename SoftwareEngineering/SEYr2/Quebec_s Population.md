### Population Growth in Quebec
From [[2016]] to [[2021]], [[Quebec]] grew at a slower rate (4.1%) than the national average (5.2%)

The birth rate is relatively high in [[Northern Quebec]], but the immigration rate is very low in most areas that are outside of the [[Montreal]] [[CMA]]

Since [[2000]], the [[House of Commons]] has increased by 41 seats but only 2 of those represent [[Quebec]]

In [[1871]], Quebec's share of [[Canada's Population]] was 32%; however, it has since declined to 23%

##### What has Caused [[Quebec]]'s decline in [[Canada's Population]] Share?
1. Expansion and Growth of the [[Canadian West]]
2. Relocation of buisnesses and corporate headquarters from Quebec to [[Ontario]]

As Quebec separatism movements gained momentum during the [[1970s]], some [[Anglophone]] owned buisnesses and corporations left the province

They feared that an independent [[Quebec]] would lead to an unattractive business climate
