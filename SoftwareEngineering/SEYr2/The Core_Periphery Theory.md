This is a model that describes interaction among regions that is evident in Canada

It is also reffered to as the heartland/hinterland theory

It is based on the idea that capitalist economies result in regionally uneven development

This theory states that both parts are dependent on each other but the core (the industrial heartland) dominates the economic relationship with the periphery (the resource hinterland)

In Canada the core is considered to be southern Ontario and southern Quebec. All other areas in the countries make up the periphery

BC and the prarie provinces are considered to be upward transistional peripheries. The atlantic Provinces are a downward transistional periphery. The territorial North is a resource frontier periphery

In general, as one travels from the core toward a periphery there are typically noticeable trends:
- Both population and population density decreases
- Median income decreases
- Unemployment increases

### Interaction
There are two contrasting ways that cores and peripheries interact:
1. Regional Exploitation:
	- The economically wealthy core exploits the natural wealth of the periphery leaving it impverished
	- This doesnt't neccesarily fit for Canada
2. Modernization
	- The core invests in the periphery and helps it to develop economically

### Sub Cores
A sub core has similar characteristics to a core but at a much smaller scale

There is evidence of sub-cores existing within Canada's peripheries:
- Vancouver/Victoria
- Edmonton/Calgary
- Halifax
