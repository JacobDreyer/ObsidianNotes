[[Resistors]] convert [[Electrical Energy]] into [[Heat Energy]]. Resistors cannot store electrical energy

[[Capacitor]] and [[Inductor]] on the other hand are devices that can store electrical energy

The stored energy can be used later in circuits

It is noted that capacitors and inductors ==do not generate energy==

The [[Energy]] that is stored can be extracted for later use

Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors are thus reffered to as [[passive device]]s

### [[Inductor]]
