[[Discrete Random Variables]] commonly arise from situations that involve counting something. Situations that involve measuring something often result in a continuous random variable

A continuous random variable Y takes on all values in an interval of numbers. The probability distribution of Y is described by a [[Density Curves]]

The probability of any event is the area under the density curve and above the values of Y that make up the event
