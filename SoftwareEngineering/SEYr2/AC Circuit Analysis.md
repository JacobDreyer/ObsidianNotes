- Analyzing AC circuits requires 3 steps:
	1. Transform the circuit to the [[Phasor]] or [[Frequency]] domain
	2. Solve the problem using circuit techniques ([[Nodal Analysis]], [[Mesh Analysis]], [[Superposition Theorem]], [[Thevenin's Theorem]], [[Norton's Theorem]], etc.)
	3. Transform the resulting phasor to the time domain
- [[Source Transformation]] in the frequency domain involves transforming a [[Voltage Source]] in series with an [[Impedance]], or vice versa

- Maximum Average Power transfer in AC circuits
	- The load is represented by $\vec Z_L$. the linear circuit can be represented by an equivalent [[Thevenin's Circuit]]
	- The load is usually represented by an [[Impedance]]
	- The maximum average power is transferred to the load $\vec Z_L$ when $\vec Z_L = (Z_{Th})^*$ where * denotes [[Complex Conjugate]]
