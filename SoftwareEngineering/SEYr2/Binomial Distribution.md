The count X of successes in a [[Binomial Setting]] has the binomial distribution with parameters n and p where n is the number of trials of the chance process, and p is the probability of a success on any one trial

In a binomial setting with n trials and success probability p, the probability of exactly x successes is
$$ P(X=x) = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} $$
