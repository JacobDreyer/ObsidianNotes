Most of the area in [[The Territorial North]] was formerly known as [[Rupert's Land]].

[[Britain]] declared ownership of this land as a result of early discovery and exploration

The area was granted to [[The Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[1670]] to operate [[Fur Trading Post]]s

Until the end of [[World War II]], the federal government generally ignored [[The Territorial North]] leaving the [[Indigenous People]]s there to live off the land

### A Strategic Frontier
After [[World War II]], [[The Territorial North]] served as a buffer zone between the [[Soviet Union]] and the rest of [[North America]]

In the [[1950s]], several [[RADAR]] stations were constructed along the $70^oN$ line of [[Latitude]]

The purpose of these was to detect potential Soviet bombers and to allow sufficient respone time for [[US]] fighter planes to destroy them
