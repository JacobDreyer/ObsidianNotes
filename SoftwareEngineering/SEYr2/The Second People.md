The second people were of French or British descent.

French explorers established [[Quebec City]] in 1608, the first permanent settlement in Canada

The area became know as [[New France]] and grew to a population of 60,000 before the arrival of British Explorers in the mid 1700's

After the British conquest of New France in 1759, British imigrants began to move to the area

This was called the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] and was a key turning point in Canadian History. The british won this battle and from this point on we were pretty much destined to become an English speaking country. Without this maybe we would have been a French speaking Country.

### Waves of British Immigration
##### First Wave:
British Loyalists living in the US supported Britain during the [[U.S. War of Independence]] (1775-83). After Britain was defeated they moved to Canada (British North America).

Many Loyalists settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Southern Ontario]].

##### Second Wave:
During the early to mid 1800's, nearly 1 million people migrated from the [[British Isles]].

This resulted from a deteriorating economy in England and the potato famine
