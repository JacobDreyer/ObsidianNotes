## Normal Distributions
- described by a [[Normal Curves]]
- specified by two numbers: [[Mean]] $\mu$ and [[Standard Deviation]] $\sigma$
- the mean is the centre of the normal curve
- The standard deviation is the distance from the centre to the change-of-curvature points on either side (centre to [[Inflection Point]])
- We abbreviate the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation as:
$$ N(\mu,\sigma) $$
![[The 68-95-99.7 Rule]]

- All normal distributions are the same if we measure in units of size $\sigma$ from the mean $\mu$ as centre
```ad-tldr
title: Definition:      Standard Normal Distribution

The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. $N(0,1)$
