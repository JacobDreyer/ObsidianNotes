- A quick and effective way to search a list that uses the [[Decrease and Conquer]] approach (a simpler version of [[Divide and Conquer Algorithm]])
- Pre-Requisite: The data MUST be sorted
- Divides the input into equal halves, and with each iteration compares the goal element with the middle element
- If the element is found, the search ends.
- Otherwise it continues looking for the element by dividing the array and selecting the appropriating section
