Provides another general procedure for analyzing circuits using [[mesh currents]]

a [[mesh loop]] is a loop that does not contain any other loop within it

mesh analysis applies [[Kirchoff's Loop Law]] to find unkwown currents

#### Steps to Determine [[Mesh Currents]]
1. Assign mesh currents $i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_n$ to the n meshes
2. Apply KLL to each of the n meshes. Use [[Ohms Law]] to express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents
3. Solve the resulting n simultaneous equations to get mesh currents
