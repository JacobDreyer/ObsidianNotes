## Postulates
#### of [[Boolean Algebra]]
1. Closure with respect to the Operators
	- OR(+)
	- AND(.)
2. Identify Elements
	- with respect to +, designated by 0: x+0=0+x=x
	- with respect to ., designated by 1: x . 1 = 1 . x = x
3. Communative
	- with respect to +: x + y = y + x
	- with respect to .: x . y = y . x
4. Distributive
	- . is distributive over + : x . (y + z) = (x . y) + (x . z)
	- + is distributive over . : x + (y . z) = (x + y) . (x + z)
5. For every element x in B there exists and element x' in B
	- x + x' = 1
	- x . x' = 0
6. There exits at least 2 elements x, y in B such that $x\neq y$
7. The Postulates need no proof
