The outputs depends on both on the given inputs and the current state of the circuit. This makes it hard to write a [[Truth Table]] for a sequential circuit.

Generally speaking we want digital circuits to have a well-defined digital state and produce a well-defined digital output when a well-defined digital input is provided

Every real physical device is well-defined but it isnt always digital

Here we want signals (outputs?) to always be unambiguously either 0 or 1
