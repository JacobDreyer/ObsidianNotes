- A file-based system refers to a method of storing and organizing data using a file system
- Typically managed by the operating system. Unlike databases managed by [[DBMS]]
- file-based systems store data in files and directories

### Limitations of File-Based Approach
1. Definition of data was embedded in application programs, rather than being stored separately and independently
2. No control over access and manipulation of data beyond that imposed by application programs
3. Limited data integrity since there's no control over the data, the file-based approach often leads to inconsistencies
4. Data retrieval and manipulation require custom programming, usually resulting in higher costs for these tasks
