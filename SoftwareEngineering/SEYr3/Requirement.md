### What is a Requirement?
##### Old Definition
A requirement is a feature that the system must have or a constraint that it must satisfy to be accepted by the client

##### New Definition
A requirement is "a usable representation of a need. The nature of the representation may be a document (or set of documents), but can vary widely depending on the circumstances"

Given the inevitable uncertainty of software systems, the difficulty of proper work estimation and the occasional conflicts between the needs, not all the requirements are feasible to be met

Prioritization is needed to help decide which requirements should have the resources allocated to them if needed

### Prioritization
For most projects it is useful to classify requirements into a hierarchy of importance. One technique that helps with this is a MoSCoW analysis
##### M - Must Have
The system must address or meet this need/requirement
##### S - Should Have
The system should include this if at all possible
##### C - Could Have
We could include this functionality if it does not impact on anything else (sometimes called Nice to Have)
##### W - Won't Have
Things that we will consider for future enhancements, but we will not include in this version of the system
