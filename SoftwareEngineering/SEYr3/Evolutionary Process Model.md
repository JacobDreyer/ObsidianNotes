Similar to [[Prototyping Development Model]]

[[Evolutionary Process Model]]s are iterative. There are 2 common process models:
1. A customer defines a set of general objectives for a software, but does not identify detailed requirements for functions and features
2. The developer may be unsure of the efficiency of an algorithm, the adaptability of an operating system, or the form that human-machine interaction should take
In these, and many other situations, a [[Prototyping Paradigm]] may offer the best approach

Both stakeholders and software engineers like the prototyping paradigm. Users get a feel for the actual system, and developers get to build something immediately

title: Problems

1. Stakeholders see what appears to be a working version of the software, unaware that the prototype is held together haphazardly and quality and long-term maintainability was not coinsidered.

2. An inappropriate operating system, language, or algorithm may be used for the sake of time/simplicty. After time you may be comfortable with these choices and forget why they are inappropriate
