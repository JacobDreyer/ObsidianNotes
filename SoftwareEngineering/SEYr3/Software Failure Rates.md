- Software is not susceptible to the environmental maladies that cause hardware to wear out. In theory, therefore, the failure rate curve for software should take the form of the "idealized curve" shown in the figure below. Undiscovered defects will cause high failure rates early in the life of a program. However, these are corrected and the curve flattens

- This is a gross oversimplification of actual failure models for software
- As changes are made, it is likely that errors are introduced, causing the failure rate to spike. Before the curve can reach it's steady state another change is introduced causing another spike. Slowly the minimum failure rate begins to rise - the software is deteriorating due to change
- Software maintenance tasks involve significantly more complexity compared to hardware maintenance as software failures indicate and error in design or process
