title: Definition

Originally proposed by [[Barry Boehm]], the spiral model is an [[Evolutionary Process Model]] that couples the iterative nature of prototyping with the controlled and systematic aspects of the [[Waterfall Development Model]]. It provides the potential for rapid development of increasingly more complete versions of the software.

Unlike other [[Process Model]]s that end when software is delivered, the spiral model can be adapted to apply throughout the life of the computer software.

The spiral model is a realistic approach to the development of large-scale systems and software. 
- Because software evolves as the process progresses, the developer and customer better understand and react to risks at each evolutionary level.
- The spiral model uses prototyping as a risk reduction mechanism but, more important, enables you to apply the prototyping approach at any stage in the evolution of the product.

The spiral model demands a direct consideration of technical risks at all stages of the project and, if properly applied, should reduce risks before they become problematic
