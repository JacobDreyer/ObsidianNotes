The foundation for software engineering is the process layer
- The process is the glue that holds the technology layers together and enables rational and timely development of computer software
- Process defines a framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology
- Forms the basis for management control of projects and establishes the context in which technical methods are applied, work products are produced, milestones are established, quality is ensured, and change is properly managed

### The Software Process
- A process is a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created. 
	- An activity strives to achieve a broad objective (e.g. communication with stakeholders) and is applied regardless of the application domain, size of the project, complexity of the effort, or degree of rigor with which [[Software Engineering]] is to be applied.
	- An action (e.g. Architectural Design) encompasses a set of tasks that produce a major work product (e.g. an architectural model)
	- A task focuses on a small, but well-defined objective (conducting a unit test) that produces a tangible outcome
- In the context of [[Software Engineering]], a process is not a rigid prescription for how to build computer software. Rather, it is an adaptable approach that enables the people doing the work (the software team) to pick and choose the appropriate set of work actions and tasks. The intent is always to deliver software in a timely manner and with sufficient quality to satisfy those who have sponsored its creation and those who will use it
- A generic process framework for software engineering encompasses five activities
	1. Communication: the intent is to understand stakeholder's objectives for the project and to gather requirements that help define software features and functions
	2. Planning: A software project is a complicated journey, and the planning activity creates a "map" that helps guide the team as it makes the journey
	3. Modeling: Whether you're a landscaper, a bridge builder, an aeronautical engineer, a carpenter, or an architect, you work with models every day. A software engineer does the same thing by creating models to better understand software requirements and the design that will achieve those requirements.
	4. Construction: What you design must be built. This activity combines code generation and the testing that is required to uncover errors in the code
	5. Deployment: The software is delivered to the customer who evaluates the delivered product and provides feedback based on the evaluation

#### Umbrella Activities
Within each step above, software engineering process framework activities are complemented by a number of umbrella activities. 

In general umbrella activities are applied throughout a software project and help a software team manage and control progress, quality, change, and risk. 

Typical umbrella activities include:
1. Software project tracking and control - allows the software team to assess progress against the project plan and take any necessary action to maintain the schedule
2. Risk Management - assesses risks that may affect the outcome of the project or the quality of the product
3. Technical Reviews - assess software engineering work products in an effort to uncover and remove errors before they are propagated to the next activity
4. Measurement - define and collects process, project, and product measure
5. Software configuration management, work product preparation, etc.
