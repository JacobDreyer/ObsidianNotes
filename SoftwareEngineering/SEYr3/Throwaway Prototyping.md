title: Definition

Creating a prototype with the intention to throw it away
```

#### Advantages
- Something tangible is produced quickly which keeps you and your user happy
- The tangible nature of the system helps the user to clarify their ideas and refine their requirements
- Misunderstandings, errors, and omissions in the requirements can be sorted out
- It improves communication with the user. It is easier to look at a working model than a document
- The prototype can test the feasibility and usefulness of the product
- Alternatives can be compared using different prototypes

#### Disadvantages
- The throw-away prototype may look messy, unsophisticated and contain bugs. This may give a bad impression to the user
- The user might think your prototype is really good and may want you to develop it into the final system, even though you had intended to throw it away. Then you will end up building your final system on potentially poorly structured code
- If you develop the throw-away prototype on a different system or in a different programming language you may not spot a technical issue that will be difficult/impossible to overcome on the target system
- It can take a lot of effort and commitment to develop something that you are eventually going to discard
