- The waterfall model is the oldest paradigm for [[Software Engineering]]. However, over the past 4 decades, criticism of this process model has caused even ardent supporters to question it's efficacy. Among the problems that are sometimes encountered when the waterfall model is applied are:
	- It is often difficult for the customer to state all requirements explicitly. The waterfall model requires this and has difficulty accommodating the natural uncertainty that exists at the beginning of many projects
	- The customer must have patience. A working version of the program(s) will not be available until late in the project time span
	- Real projects rarely follow the sequential flow that the model proposes. As a result, changes can cause confusion as the project team
	- The linear nature of the classic life cycle leads to "blocking states" in which some project team members must wait for other team members to complete dependent tasks. In fact, the time spent waiting can exceed the time spent working on productive work
	- The linear model assumes everything will go straightforward. Furthermore, it also assumes the stakeholders know exactly every demand. However, not everything goes smoothly.
