We introduced a generic [[The Software Engineering Process]] model composed of a set of activities that establish a framework for software engineering practice. Generic framework activities - communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment - and umbrella activities establish a skeleton architecture for [[Software Engineering]] work. But how does the practice of software engineering fit in?

The essence of practice includes:
1. Understand the problem (communication and analysis, sometimes from my experience is to analyze the problem to lower the misunderstanding/expectation bar between parties)
	- It's sometimes difficult to admit but most of us suffer from hubris when presented with a problem. We listen for a few seconds and then think, oh yeah, I understand, let's get on with solving this thing. Unfortunately understanding isn't always that easy. It's worth spending a little time answering a few simple questions:
		- Who has a stake in the solution to the problem? That is, who are the stakeholders
		- What are the unknowns? What data, functions, and features are required to properly solve the problem?
		- Can the problem be compartmentalized? Is it possible to represent smaller problems that may be easier to understand?
		- Can the problem be represented graphically? Can an analysis model be created
2. Plan a solution (modeling and software design)
	- Have you seen similar problems before? Are there patterns that are recognizable in a potential solution? Is there existing software that implements the data, functions, and features that are required?
	- Has a similar problem been solved? If so, are elements of the solution reusable?
	- Can subproblems be defined? If so, are solutions readily apparent for the subproblems?
	- Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation? Can a design model be created?
3. Carry out the plan (coding)
4. Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance)
