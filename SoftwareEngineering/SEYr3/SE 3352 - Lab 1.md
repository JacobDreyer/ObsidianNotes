## Task 1: Familiarize yourself with this type of system
#### Look up Examples
Look up online examples of self checkout systems and list 3 links of different examples
- https://www.magestore.com/features/magento-pos/
	- https://www.magestore.com/self-checkout-systems-in-retail/?utm_nav=footer
- https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2022/06/02/coming-to-stores-a-new-type-of-self-checkout-where-no-scanning-is-required/?sh=3dc4db4b424c

#### Test out in-store systems
Self-checkout is available in many stores in London (e.g. Shoppers Drug Mart, Costco, Sobeys … etc.). Find at least two stores and observe or try out how their self-checkout systems work, and submit a description of what you did to learn the systems.
#### Compare
Compare what you observed in the local stores to the examples you found online (e.g. similarities vs. differences, pros vs. cons) and state what you learned from the comparison (e.g. did you get at least a vague idea of how the new system should look like? … etc.)
##### Magento
```ad-success
title: Advantages

- Offers ability to use the same system for self-ceheckout as well as normal checkout and online purchases
- Able to use on tablets to sell on sale floor or at events
- Lots of customization and support
- Create orders without internet connection
```

```ad-failure
title: Disadvantages

- Self-checkout is not a built in feature and requires additional setup/configuration
- 
```
##### Mashgin
```ad-success
title: Advantages

- Much quicker time to checkout by eliminating scanning
- Touchless
```

```ad-failure
title: Disadvantages

- New technology so possibility for errors
- New technology also means users may not be familiar with the concept
- Small tray means it likely can only handle a few items at a time
- Possibility for items to be hid under other items
- Likely higher cost
```
##### SelfServe90
```ad-success
title: Advantages

- Variety of mounting options (countertop, pedastal, wall)
- Smaller foot print
```

```ad-fail
title: Disadvantages

- Less space for items
- No integrated scale
- Does not accept cash/coins
- likely cheaper
```
##### Costco
At Costco I purchased some items with my roomates and went through the self checkout line to understand and get a sense of how it works
```ad-success
title: Advantages

- Much quicker than ordinary lines
- Straight forward to use and understand
- No issues with scanning
- Lots of self-checkout registers
- Self checkout also available for food
```

```ad-failure
title: Disadvantages

- Having to get out your wallet to scan Costco card before scanning items and then get it out again to pay
- Did not accept roomate's card
```
##### Food Basics
```ad-success
title: Advantages

- Accepts cash
- Straight forward to use and understand
```

```ad-failure
title: Disadvantages

- Slower than Costco
- Something scanned wrong and needed assistance from employee
- Entering produce difficult/cumbersome
```
##### Summary
Costco's self checkout system was probably one of the best overall implementations. However, in a new system the user should either not be required to display a membership card or show it at time of purchase. Self-checkout system should also work with all common types of card and cash. Depending target stores a smaller self checkout system like the SelfServ90 may be a better model to base off of. The Mashgin solution is interesting and would be a good model to base off of if stakeholder's are willing to go with something that requires more development and testing to ensure proper functionality. For grocery stores however, the vision system and tray would likely need to be much larger. The Magento system likely is not a good example for retail situations as it requires more setup/development while not taking advantages of its strengths.

## Task 2: Who are the Stakeholders?
List at least 5 stakeholders you would need to talk to or elicit requirements from and the elicitation technique that you think would be most appropriate for each. 
- Start by attempting to answer this question on your own. 
- Find an answer generated by AI-help tools like ChatGPT 
- Compare the two answers and state what you’ve learned from the comparison.

#### Answering on my Own
- Users
	- Questionnaires and Surveys
- Employees
	- Interview
- Tech Support
	- Workshop
- Store Manager
	- Interview
- Investors
	- Interview
#### ChatGPT Response:
1. **Retail Store Customers:**
    - Elicitation Technique: Surveys and Questionnaires
        - Surveys and questionnaires can be distributed to customers in the store or conducted online to gather feedback about their preferences, needs, and expectations regarding a self-checkout system. You can ask them about their experiences with existing systems and what features they would find most useful.
2. **Store Managers and Staff:**
    - Elicitation Technique: Interviews
        - Conduct interviews with store managers and staff who will be responsible for overseeing and assisting customers with self-checkout. Through interviews, you can gain insights into operational requirements, potential challenges, and necessary training.
3. **User Experience (UX) Designers:**
    - Elicitation Technique: Focus Groups or Workshops
        - Organize focus group sessions or workshops with UX designers to discuss the user interface, usability, and design aspects of the self-checkout system. Their expertise can help refine the system's user experience.
4. **Loss Prevention Specialists:**
    - Elicitation Technique: Scenario-based Analysis
        - Work with loss prevention specialists to analyze potential security vulnerabilities and develop scenarios to understand how the self-checkout system might be exploited for theft or fraud. This technique helps in defining security requirements.
5. **IT and Technical Teams:**
    - Elicitation Technique: Prototyping and Mock-ups
        - Collaborate with IT and technical teams to create prototypes or mock-ups of the self-checkout system. These visual representations can help technical stakeholders better understand the system's architecture, hardware requirements, and integration needs.

#### Compare
in my suggestion I missed out on Loss Prevention Specialists and UX Designers. In the future I need to think of more departments that would want/need to have a stake in the system. I also did not think of using mock-ups to convey structure and architecture of a system and should probably prioritize that if possible in future situations

## Task 4: Starter Interview
#### Question 1:
Have you ever used a self-checkout system before? why or why not?
##### Answer 1:
Yeah, I used self-checkout systems before. they're pretty good because they often have shorter lines, and I can finish quickly without waiting for a cashier and also the lines are usually shorter.
##### Answer 2:
Yes but I prefer having a cashier handle my transactions to ensure everything goes smoothly. when I used self checkout it seemed to be too easy to make a mistake and require the cashier to have to come help
#### Question 2:
What did you like or dislike about it?
##### Answer 1:
I like how quick it is to get through self checkout in most places. However, I didn't like the lack of assistance when I had a question or an item didn't scan correctly.
##### Answer 2:
I did like that it was a much shorter line to get through but it almost still felt slower with how if you didn't do it perfectly it would case an error and make you wait for assistance.
#### Question 3:
What features, functionalities, or changes would make self-checkout better for you?
##### Answer 1:
I feel like the best improvement to the current system would be something to improve scanning produce as currently it is pretty annoying trying to find a code, enter it, and weigh it
##### Answer 2:
If self-checkout systems could be more lenient with how fast or what order you do things and offer more payment options, such as mobile wallets, I might use it more often
#### Question 4:
What payment methods do you use at self-checkout?
##### Answer 1:
I usually use my credit card because it's quick. I also like the option to receive digital receipts
##### Answer 2:
I usually use my debit card or my phone to pay.

#### Question 5:
What resources or guidance would help you feel more comfortable using self-checkout?
##### Answer 1:
Having an employee available nearby to answer questions or provide assistance would definitely make it easier when there is a problem. Additionally, a way to sort out the error by myself would be nice
##### Answer 2:
Having clear step-by-step instructions displayed on the screen would make it easier for me to follow along instead of guessing what it wants me to do next.
