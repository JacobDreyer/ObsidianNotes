The [[Internet]] was not originally designed with much security in mind:
- Original vision: "A group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network"
- Internet protocol designers playing "catch up"
- security considerations in all layers

We now need to think about:
- how bad guys can attack computer networks
- how we can defend networks against attacks
- how to design architectures that are immune to attacks
