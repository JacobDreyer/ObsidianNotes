- Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed
- Use var (or let in ES6) to declare variables
- Assignment can happen at declaration-time by appending the value to the declaration, or at run time with a simple right-to-left assignment
## Declaring with var
```js
var a = 42
```
- Global when used outside a function
- Local when used in a function
- Does not obey block scope
## Declaring with let
```js
let x = 69
```
- Obeys block scope
