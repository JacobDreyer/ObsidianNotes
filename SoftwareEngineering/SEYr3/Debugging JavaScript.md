- Browsers ignore JavaScript errors
	- May see "undefined" if a variable is not initialized or empty if null or causes a Reference Error
- Appears that your scripts are not doing anything
	- No feedback to indicate there is something wrong
- Use the built-in developer tools to see the error messages
	- Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent dev tools including a full debugger
	- Much more than checking errors
