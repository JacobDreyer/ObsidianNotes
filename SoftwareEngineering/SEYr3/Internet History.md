### 1980-1990 New Protocols, a Proliferation of Networks
- [[1983]]: deployment of TCP/IP
- [[1982]]: smtp email protocol defined
- [[1983]]: [[DNS]] defined for name-to-IP-address translation
- [[1985]]: [[FTP]] Protocol defined
- [[1988]]: [[TCP]] congestion control
- New national networks: [[CSnet]], [[BITnet]], [[NSFnet]], [[Minitel]]
- 100,000 hosts connected to confederation of networks
### 1990, 2000s: Commercialization, The Web, New Applications
- early [[1990s]]: 
	- [[ARPAnet]] decommissioned
	- Web
		- [[Hypertext]]
		- [[HTML]], [[HTTP]]: [[Tim Berners-Lee]]
		- [[1994]]: [[Mosaic]], later [[Netscape]]
		- late [[1990s]]: commercialization of the web
- [[1991]]: [[NSF]] lifts restrictions on commercial use of [[NSFnet]] (decommissioned, [[1995]])
- late [[1990s]]-[[2000s]]:
	- more killer apps: instant messaging, [[P2P File Sharing]]
	- network security to forefront
	- est. 50 million host, 100 million+ users
	- [[Backbone Link]]s running at Gbps
### 2005-Present: Scale, SDN, Mobility, Cloud
- aggressive deployment of broadband home access (10-100's Mbps)
- [[2008]]: [[Software Defined Network]] ([[SDN]])
- Increasing ubiquity of high-speed wireless access: 4G/5G, [[WiFi]]
- Service providers ([[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Microsoft]]) create their own networks
	- bypass commercial internet to connect "close" to end user, providing "instantaneous" access to social media, search, video content
- Enterprises run their services in "cloud" (e.g. [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Microsoft Azure]])
- Rise of smartphones: more mobile than fixed devices on internet
- ~15B devices attached to internet
