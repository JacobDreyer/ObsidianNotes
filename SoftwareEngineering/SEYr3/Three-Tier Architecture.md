Consists of three layers:
- [[Presentation Layer]]: This is the [[User Interface]], typically a web or desktop application where users interact
- [[Application Logic Layer]] (or [[Business Logic Layer]]): Here, all business rules and operations are processed. It acts as a mediator for communication between the presentation layer and data layers
- [[Data Layer]]: Contains the actual [[Database]], responsible for storing and retrieving data
