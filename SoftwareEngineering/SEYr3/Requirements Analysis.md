## Specifying and Modeling
Specify and Model requirements describe the practices for analyzing [[Requirements Elicitation]] results and creating representations of those results

Afterwards verify and make sure the requirements meet the stakeholder's needs and business goals

Make sure to include traceability information while creating models/artifacts

### Glossary
- To limit the vocabulary and reduce ambiguity
- If there are existing terms specifically used in the business it's good to have it listed and defined
- If multiple terms are used interchangeably, linking them together and trying to unify the term would make the communication easier
### The Scope
- In the [[BABOK]] guide, the scope is listed as one of the inputs to the modeling process
- However, it's not always that easy to figure out and communicate
- Luckily some experts suggested as part of the 'domain model'

## Traceability

### Types of Traceability
#### [[Forward Traceability]]
- Starting from an artifact (e.g. document, model, requirement, test case, ..., etc) we should be able to find all artifacts that were dependent on it
#### [[Backward Traceability]]
- Starting from an artifact we should be able to find all artifacts that it depended on (sources)
#### [[Bidirectional Traceability]]
- Starting from an artifact we should be able to find all artifacts that lead to it and built on it
