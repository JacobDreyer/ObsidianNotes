- Like conditionals, loops use the () and {} blocks to define the condition and the body of the loop
- While loops normally initialize a loop control variable before the loop, use it in the condition, and modify it within the loop
```js
let i=0;
while (i<10){
	i++
}
```
- a for loop combines the common components of a loop; initialization, condition, and post loop operation into one statement
```js
for (var i=0; i<10; i++){
	//do something with i
}
```
