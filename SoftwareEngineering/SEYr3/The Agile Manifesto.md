- Created in [[2001]] by 17 experienced software developers including the two [[Scrum]] founders [[Ken Schwaber]] and [[Jeff Sutherland]]
- Formed the central values of agile software development
- The manifesto includes a set of value pairs
	- In each pair the value on the left should be given higher priority than the value on the right
- [[Agile Alliance]] backed up the manifesto with the 12 principles

##### Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
##### Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
##### Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
##### Responding to Change over Following a Plan

### 12 [[Agile Principles]]
1. Satisfy the Customer - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome Changing Requirements - changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
3. Deliver Frequently - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
4. Cross Functional and Cross Divisional Collaboration - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5. Provide Support and Trust - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done
6. Personal Communication - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
7. Working Software - Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable Pace - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9. Pursuit of technical excellence - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity is essential - Simplicity is the art of maximizing the amount of work that is not done
11. Acting self-organized - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Inspection and Adaptation - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly
