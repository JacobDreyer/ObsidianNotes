- Teams in this approach usually range from 5 to 7 team members
- Three main roles are identified in Scrum
	- the [[Scrum Master]] (essentially the project manager who coaches and facilitates the team)
	- the [[Product Owner]] (represents the views of the customer and itemizes the order of product development)
	- [[Team Member]] (Who creates and owns his or her own estimates for work)
- The work in Scrum is broken down into manageable chunks refered to as Sprints. Theses are cycles of the [[Incremental Development Model]] or [[Evolutionary Prototyping]] approaches and are sized to take between one week and one month to complete
- Each sprint produces something of value - a deliverable product increment
