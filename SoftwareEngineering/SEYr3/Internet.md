Composed of billions of connected computing devices:
### Terms
- [[Internet Host]]s = end systems
- running network apps at internet's edge

[[Packet Switches]]: forward packets (chunks of data)
- [[Router]]s, [[Switch]]es

[[Communication Links]]
- [[Fiber]], [[Copper]], [[Radio]], [[Satellitte]]
- [[Transmission Rate]]: [[Bandwidth]]

[[Networks]]
- collection of devices, [[Router]]s, links: managed by an organization

Internet: "Network of networks"
- Interconnected [[ISP]]s ([[Internet Service Provider]])

[[Protocol]]s are everywhere
- control sending, receiving messages
- e.g. [[HTTP]] (Web), streaming video, [[Skype]], [[TCP]], [[IP]], [[WiFi]], 4/5G, [[Ethernet]]

[[Internet Standard]]s
- [[RFC]]: [[Request for Comments]]
- [[IETF]]: [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]

- [[Internet Host]]s connect to internet via access [[Internet Service Provider]]s ([[ISP]]s)
- Access [[ISP]]s in turn must be interconnected so that any 2 hosts can send packets to each other
- resulting network of networks is very complex. Evolution driven by economics, and national policies
- Access ISP connects to global transit ISP. If one global ISP is viable then there will be competitors
- [[Internet Exchange Point]]s can connect global ISPs
- Regional networks may arise to connect access nets to ISPs
- [[Content Provider Network]]s (e.g. [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Akamai]]) may run their own network, to bring services, content close to end users

- At Center: small # of well-connected large networks
	- "tier-1" commercial [[ISP]]s (e.g. level 3, [[Sprint]], [[AT&T]], [[NTT]]), national & international coverage
	- [[Content Provider Network]]s (e.g. [[Google]], [[Facebook]]): private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs


#### A "Services" View
Infrastructure that provides services to applications
- Web, Streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e-commerce, social media, inter-connected appliances

Provides programming interface to distributed applications:
- "hooks" allowing sending/receiving apps to "connect" to, use internet transport service
- provides service options, analogous to postal service
