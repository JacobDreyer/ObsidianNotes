### Main Characteristics of the Database Approach
1. Self-describing nature of a database system
	- A catalog stores the description of the database
	- The description is also called [[Metadata]]
	- This allows the [[DBMS]] software to work with different databases
2. Insulation between programs and data
	- called program-data independence
	- Allows changing data storage structures and operations without having to change the [[DBMS]] access programs
3. [[Data Abstraction]]
	- A data model is used to hide storage details and present the users with a conceptual view of the database
##### Views
- Allows each user to have his or her own view of the database
- A view is essentially some subset of the [[Database]] constructed using one or more tables

Benefits:
- Reduce complexity
- Provide a level of security
- Provide a mechanism to customize the appearance of the database
