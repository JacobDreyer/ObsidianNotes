Key information in the domain model includes:
- Core ideas and concepts that define the domain
- Best practice knowledge, processes and principles in the domain
- Core curricula (formal instructional materials)
- Business and work-relevant contextual information

The Domain Model is NOT:
- People's current knowledge - it may be incomplete or incorrect
- The developer's perspective of what it should be
- The organization's (often legacy) view of how it operates in the broader domain
- Anything to do with any technology

A mind map can be a good visual for such as model. All models should be created progressively and if possible with hierarchical decomposition up to 3 levels + try to keep it at 4 or 5 concepts per level

System Structure can be used for domain modeling too
