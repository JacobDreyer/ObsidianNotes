#### Management Myths
Myth: If we get behind schedule, we can add more programmers and catch up (sometimes called the "[[Mongolian Horde]]" concept)
Reality: Software development is not a mechanistic process like manufacturing. In the words of Brooks: "adding people to a late software project makes it later".

Myth: If I decide to outsource the software project to a third party, I can just relax and let that firm build it.
Reality: If an organization does not understand how to manage and control software projects internally, it will invariably struggle when it outsources software projects.

#### Customer Myths
A customer who requests computer software may be a person at the next desk, a technical group down the hall, the marketing/sales department, or an outside company that has requested software under contract. In many cases, the customer believes myths about software because software managers and practitioners do little to correct misinformation. Myths lead to false expectations (by the customer) and, ultimately, dissatisfaction with the developer

Myth: A general statement of objectives is sufficient to begin writing programs - we can fill in the details later.
Reality: Although a comprehensive and stable statement of requirements is not always possible, an ambiguous "statement of objectives" is a recipe for disaster. Unambiguous requirements (usually derived iteratively) are developed only through effective and continuous communication between customer and developer

Myth: Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible
Reality: It is true that software requirements change, but the impact of change varies with the time at which it is introduced

#### Practitioner Myths
Myths that are still believed by software practitioners have been fostered by over 60 years of programming culture. During the early days, programming was viewed as an art form. Old ways and attitudes die hard

Myth: Once we write the program and get it to work, our job is done.
Reality: Someone once said that "the sooner you begin 'writing code' the longer it'll take you to get done" Industry data indicates that between 60 to 80 percent of all effort expended on software will be expended after it is delivered to the customer for the first time.

Myth: The only deliverable work product for a successful project is the working program.
Reality: A working program is only one part of a software configuration that includes many elements. A variety of work products (e.g. models, documents, plans) provide a foundation for successful engineering and, more important, guidance for software support
