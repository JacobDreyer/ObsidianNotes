#### 1. Communication
Meet with stakeholders to define the overall objectives of the software. 
- Identify known requirements
- Outline areas where further definition is required
#### 2. Plan Prototype Iteration and Model
A quick design focuses on a representation of those aspects of the software that will be visible to end users (human interface layout or output display formats)
#### 3. Prototype
The quick design leads to the construction of a prototype. The prototype is deployed and evaluated by stakeholders, who provide feedback that is used to further refine requirements.
#### 4. Iterate
Iteration occurs, cycle repeats, as the prototype is tuned to satisfy the needs of various stakeholders, while at the same time enabling you to better understand what needs to be done
