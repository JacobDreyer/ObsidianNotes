## General Principles
1. The reason it all exists: To provide value to its users
2. Keep it Simple. All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler
	1. Simple also does not mean "Quick and Dirty"
	2. Keep the idea simple, but coding may be complicated
	3. It often takes a lot of thought and work over multiple iterations to simplify. The payoff is that software is more maintainable and easy to use.
