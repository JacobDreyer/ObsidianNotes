### Physical Media
- Bit:
	- propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- Physical Link:
	- What lies between transmitter and receiver
- [[Guided Media]]:
	- Signals propagate in solid media: [[Copper]], [[Fiber]], [[Coax]]
- [[Unguided Media]]:
	- Signals propagate freely, e.g. [[Radio]]
- [[Twisted Pair]] ([[TP]])
	- 2 insulated [[Copper Wire]]s
		- Category 5: 100Mbps, 1 Gbps [[Ethernet]]
		- Category 6: 10Gbps [[Ethernet]]
- [[Coaxial Cable]]
	- Two concentric [[Copper]] conducters
	- bidirectional
	- broadband
		- Multiple frequency channels on cable
		- 100's Mbps per channel
- [[Fiber Optic Cable]]
	- glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
	- high-speed operation:
		- high-speed point-to-point transmission (10's-100's Gbps)
	- low error rate
		- repeaters spaced far apart
		- immune to electromagnetic noise
- [[Wireless Radio]]
	- signal carried in various "bands" in [[electromagnetic spectrum]]
	- no physical "wire"
	- broadcast, "[[Half-Duplex]]" (sender to receiver)
	- Propagation environment effects:
		- Reflection
		- Obstruction by objects
		- Interference/Noise
- Radio Link Types
	- [[Wireless LAN]] ([[WiFi]])
		- 10-100's Mbps; 10's meters
	- Wide-area (e.g. [[4G_5G Cellular]])
		- 10's Mbps (4G) over ~10km
	- [[Bluetooth]]: cable replacement
		- short distances, limited rates
	- [[Terrestrial Microwave]]
		- point-to-point, 45 Mbps channels
	- [[Satellite]]
		- up to < 100 Mbps ([[Starlink]]) downlink
		- 270msec end-to-end delay ([[Geostationary]])
