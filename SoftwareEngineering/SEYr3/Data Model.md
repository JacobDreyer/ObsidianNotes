- The data model is equivalent to a logical data model
- Represents the nouns and their basic relationships with each other
- The adjectives are the attributes in the underlying tables, representing properties or states
- A simplified [[Class Diagram]] ([[Entity Relationship Diagram]]) would be sufficient
	- Just the class/entity names (with attributes if possible)
	- Basic description of the relationship is sufficient at this level, the details can be added later
- All models should be created progressively and if possible with hierarchical decomposition up to 3 levels
- On level 2 and deeper models, a group shows how a set of entities relates to the parent entity
