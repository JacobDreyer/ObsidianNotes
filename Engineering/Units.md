## Units
- Units of all sorts of measurements

#### Physics
[[Electric Charge]]
- The unit of ==electric charge== is the ==Coulomb (C)==
- Charge on 1 electron:
$$ e = 1.602\cdot 10^{-19} \;C$$
- So you need $6.24\cdot10^{18}$ [[electrons]] to make 1 C of charge

[[Coulomb's Constant]]
$k$ = [[Coulomb's Constant]] = $8.988\cdot10^9 \frac{N\;m^2}{C^2}$

[[Permittivity of Free Space]]
$\epsilon_0$ = permittivity of free space = $8.854\cdot10^{-12}\; \frac{C^2}{N\;m^2}$

[[Electric Potential Energy]]
The unit is Nm which is the same as the joule (J)

[[Capacitance]]
Units = (C/V) = farads (F)

[[Current]]
Units: C/s = Ampere(Amps)(A)

[[Power]]
Units = (J/s) = Watts (W)

[[Magnetic Field]] ($B$)
Units = Tesla (T)

[[Frequency]]
Units = (cycles/second, Hz, $s^{-1}$)
