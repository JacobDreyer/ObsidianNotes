## Improper Integrals
Type 1:
- one or both limits of [[Integration]] are infinity
- Integrate function, see if it is convergent (limit of answer goes to number)
$$ \int_a^\infty f(x)dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}\int_a^R f(x)dx $$
Type 2:
- f(x) is divergent as x approaches integration limits
- Same process as type 1 improper integral
