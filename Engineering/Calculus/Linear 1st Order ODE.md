## Linear First Order Ordinary Differential Equations
Given:
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x) $$
Answer:
$$ y(x) = e^{-\mu(x)}\cdot\int e^{\mu(x)}\cdot q(x)dx + C\cdot e^{-\mu(x)} $$
- where $\mu(x)$ = $\int p(x)dx$ 
- [[Professor Leonard]] has a great video([[Linear Differential Equations by Professor Leonard]]) explaining how this works
