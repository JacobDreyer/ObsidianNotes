## [[Integral]] Test
- test used to check convergence of a [[Series]]/[[Sequence]]

- pretend our [[Sequence]] is a function $f(n) = a_n$
- if $f(n)$ is [[Continuous]], Positive, and Decreasing
	- then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ and $\int_1^\infty f(x)dx$ will both either converge or diverge
	- does not necessarily give the sum
