## Sequences
- A sequence of numbers
- Usually following a formula

Characterizing Sequences:
- {$a_n$} is bounded from below by L if L < $a_n$ for all n
- {$a_n$} is bounded from above by M if M > $a_n$ for all n
- {$a_n$} is bounded if its bounded from above and below
- {$a_n$} is positive if the lower bound = 0

Convergence:
let {$a_n$} be a sequence defined by $a_n = f(n)$ 
- If $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n) = L$ the sequence converges to L
- A series is divergent if the limit DNE or L = $\pm \infty$
