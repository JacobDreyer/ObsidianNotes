## Higher Order Derivatives

#### For [[Multi-Variable Functions]]
- Same as for single variable fuction there are just more options
- For example you can differentiate with regards to x and then differentiate that with regards to y
$$ f(x,y)\to\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\to\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\to\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial y\;\partial x^2} $$
- Note $\partial y$ goes out front. you add each partial to the front 
- Next Form is nicer/more intuitive
$$ f(x,y)\to f_{x}\to f_{xx}\to f_{xxy} $$
