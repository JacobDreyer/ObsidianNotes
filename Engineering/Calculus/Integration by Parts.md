## Integration by Parts
$$ \int u\cdot dv = u\cdot v - \int v\cdot du $$
- Used when the integral is too complicated to calculate normally
- Seperate the given equation by assigning 1 piece to u and the other to dv
- dv will consist of the leftovers, including dx

##### Rules of Thumb
- $e^x$ combines into dv
- $\ln x$ into u
- $\sin x \cos x$ combines into dv
