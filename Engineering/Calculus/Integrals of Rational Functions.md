## Integrals of Rational Functions

$$ f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$
and degree of P(x) < degree of Q(x)
if it isnt then do long division so that it is

Steps:
- Given equation, factor denominator
- Seperate sections of denominator and have a constant on top of each one (so that each new segment is being added)
- make a common denomiator
- figure out what each of the constants must be equal to
- go back to when everything was seperated, sub in the constants, do integral

Ex. 
$$ f(x) = \frac{x+4}{(x-2)(x-3)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-3} = \frac{(A+B)x + (-3A-2B)}{(x-2)(x-3)} $$
$A+B = 1$     
$-3A-2B = 4$ 

$A = -6$
$B = 7$

$$ = \frac{-6}{x-2} + \frac{7}{x-3} $$
