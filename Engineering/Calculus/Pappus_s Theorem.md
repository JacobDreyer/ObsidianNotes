## Pappus's Theorem
1. Find the Volume of a plane region revolved around an axis
$$ V = 2\pi r\cdot A $$
Where A is area of place or crossectional area
r = distance of [[Centroids]] to axis of rotation

2. Find Surface area of a curve revolved around an axis
$$ A = 2\pi r\cdot s $$
A = surface area
