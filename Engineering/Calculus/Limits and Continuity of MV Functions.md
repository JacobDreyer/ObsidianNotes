## Limits and Continuity of MV Functions
$$ \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L $$
- There are inifite # of paths to our point
- To prove continuity we must prove that ALL paths approach the same point
	- Very hard to do
- We can use [[Squeeze Theorem]]
- We can prove when a limit doesn't exist

###### Prove a Limit Doesn't Exist
- Show that 2 paths do not approach the same point

- Restrict one of the variables
	- ex for limit at a point (0,0) set x = 0
- You can then sub that # in and find limit just as y approaches point

- Try $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ first
- Then try other paths ($y = f(x)$, $x = f(y)$)
	- make sure point is along the path
	- make sure degree of numerator and denominator are the same
