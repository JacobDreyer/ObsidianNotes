## Inverse Substitutions
- Used for integrals that look like/have: $a^2 + x^2$
- consider a triangle. Determine where it makes most sense for each element to be located ($a^2$,  $x^2$ , ($a^2-x^2$))
- create expression using sin, tan that x is equal to
- sub in for ALL xs and solve and input dx
- Everything should be in terms of $\theta$ 
- simplify using [[Trig Identities]]
- do [[Integration]]
- Replace all instances of $\theta$ to be in terms of x
