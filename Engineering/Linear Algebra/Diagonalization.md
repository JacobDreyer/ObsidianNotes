## Diagonalization
- If $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $P$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and has a [[Matrix Inverse]]:
$$ A \longrightarrow P^{-1}\cdot A \cdot P $$
- Is called a similarity transformation
- if by this we acheive a diagonal matrix, $A$ is diagonalizable
- if $A$ has $n$ linearly independent [[Eigenvectors]], it is diagonalizable

- $P$ = matrix made up from [[Eigenvectors]]
