## Row Echelon Form (REF)
- A form of [[Matrices]]
- Can be used to solve [[Linear Systems]]

A Matrix is in REF is:
- The first non-zero number in a row is 1 (called a leading 1)
- The leading 1 of the lower row is always to the right of the leading 1 of the upper row (leading 1s creating a diagonal from top left to bottom right)

- Use [[Matrix Operations]] to get to REF

#### Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)
- Get the matrix to REF
- Simplify further using [[Matrix Operations]] such that any coloumn with a leading 1 has only zeros in every other coloumn element

- Any variable corresponding to columns with leading 1s are ==Leading Variables==
- Any variable corresponding to columns without leading 1s are ==Free Variables==


#### Any Matrix can be Reduced:
###### ==Any Matrix  -> REF -> RREF==
