## Basis Dimension
- Any [[Vector Space]] $V$ will have a basis. In fact, $V$ can have many different basis. All such basis of $V$ have the same number of vectors. This # = dimension of $V$
$$ \dim(\mathbb{R}^n) = n $$
$$ P_3 \; : \{1,x,x^2,x^3\} \qquad \dim(P_3) = 4 \qquad \dim(P_n) = n+1 $$
$$ 
M_{2\times 2} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad \dim(M_{2\times 2}) = 4 \qquad \dim(M_{m\times n}) = m\cdot n
$$
- vector of functions of a single variable: $\dim(\digamma) = \infty$

- If $W \subset V$ is a subspace of $V$ then the dimension of W is less or equal to that of $V$
- If $\dim(W) = \dim(V) \Rightarrow W = V$
- If $W \neq \{\vec 0\} \subset V$ is a subspace of $V$ and $\dim(W) < \dim(V)$ then $W$ is a ==proper subspace== of $V$ 

- Dimension will equal # of free varibles
