## Null Space
- space of solutions to a homogenous system
$$ A\cdot\vec X = \vec 0 $$
- is a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$
- null space is not changed by [[Elementary Row Operations]]

- Find $3\times 3$ [[Matrices]] who null space is:
	- A point
	- a line: 
		- 1 free variable
	- a plane:
		- 2 free variables
