## Row Space
- The rowspace of $A$ is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned by the rows of $A$
$$ \vec r_1 = (a_{11}, a_{12}, \cdots, a_{2n}) $$
$$ \vec r_2 = (a_{21}, a_{22}, \cdots, a_{1n}) $$
$$ \cdots $$
$$ \vec r_m = (a_{m1}, a_{m2}, \cdots, a_{mn}) $$
- The row space is not changed by [[Elementary Row Operations]]
