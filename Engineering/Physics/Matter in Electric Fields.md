## [[Matter]] in [[Electric Field]]s
#### [[Acceleration]] due to [[Newton's Second Law]]
$$ a = \frac{q}{m}\vec E $$
- $q$ = charge of particle in electric field
- $m$ = mass
- $\vec E$ = [[Electric Field]]

#### [[Conductor]]
- When conductors have a charge the excess [[electrons]] repel each other
- As a result the charge on a conductor resides on the surface
