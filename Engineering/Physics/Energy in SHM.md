## Energy in SHM
- Sum of total energy will be the combination of [[Kinetic Energy]] of the mass and the [[Elastic Potential Energy]] in the spring
- Kinetic energy oscillates with a [[Frequency]] twice that of position
- Same with Elastic potential energy

[[Kinetic Energy]]
$$ K = \frac12mv^2 $$
- $m$ = mass
- $v$ = velocity
- $K$ = Kinetic Energy

[[Elastic Potential Energy]]
$$ U = \frac12kx^2 $$
- $U$ = Elastic Potential Energy
- $k$ = Spring constant
- $x$ = displacement from [[Equilibrium]]

Total [[Energy]]
$$ E = \frac12kA^2 $$
- $k$ = spring constant
- $A$ = Amplitude
- $E$ = total energy of system
