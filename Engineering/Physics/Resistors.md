## Resistors in Series and Parallel [[Circuit]]
- Devices that dissipate energy
- used for controlling [[Current]] and changing [[Potential Difference]]
- Resistance can be found using [[Ohms Law]]:
$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$

#### Resistors in Series
$$ R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 $$
Voltage across a Resistor in Series:
$$ V_1 = \frac{\epsilon R_1}{R_1+R_2} $$
- $\epsilon$ = [[Electromotive Force]](emf)(voltage battery provides)


#### Resistors in Parallel
$$ R_{eq} = (\frac1{R_1}+\frac1{R_2})^{-1} $$

Current through a Resistor in Parallel
$$ I_1 = I\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} $$
- $I$ = Current through battery
