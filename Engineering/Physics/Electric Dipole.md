## Electric Dipole
- an electric dipole consists of two [[Electric Charge]]s of equal magnitude but opposite sign seperated by some small distance
- The ==dipole moment== is equal to $p = qd$ where d is the distance between the charges (q) and points from the - charge to the + charge
- The torque of a dipole in an electric field is given by:
$$ \vec{\tau} = \vec{p}\times\vec{E} = pE\sin\varphi $$
- $\vec p$ = dipole moment
- $\varphi$ = angle between [[Electric Field]] and $\vec p$
- $\vec E$ = Electric Field

#### On-Axis [[Electric Field]] of an Electric Dipole
$$ E = \frac{2kp}{x^3} $$
- $k$ = [[Coulomb's Constant]] = $8.988\cdot10^9 \frac{N\;m^2}{C^2}$
- $p$ = dipole moment
- $x$ = distance away from dipole (On-axis)
