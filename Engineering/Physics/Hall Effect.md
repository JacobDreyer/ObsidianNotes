## Hall Effect
$$ \vec F = I\vec L\times\vec B $$
- The [[Electric Force]] on a current carying conductor
$$ V_H = Eh = v_dBh = \frac{IB}{nqt} $$
- $V_H$ = [[voltage]] across width of conductor
- $h$ = width of conductor
- $E$ = [[Electric field]]
- $v_d$ = drift velocity
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $n$ = density of charge carriers
- $t$ = thickness of conductor in direction of $B$
- $q$ = charge
