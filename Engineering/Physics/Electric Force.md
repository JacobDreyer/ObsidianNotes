## Electric Force
- The force of an [[electric charge]] on another charged particle
- Force is a [[Vector]] quantity meaning it has direction and a [[Vector Magnitude]]
- Force given by [[Coulomb's Law]]:
$$ F_{12} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r} $$
- Like charges repel $\qquad\qquad \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\;>\;0$
- Opposite charges attract $\qquad\qquad \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\;<\;0$
- Obeys [[Newton's Third Law]] $F_{12} = -F_{21}$

- [[Coulomb's Constant]] (k) can also be expressed in terms of the [[Permittivity of Free Space]]
$$ k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} $$
- $\epsilon_0$ = permittivity of free space = $8.854\cdot10^{-12}\; \frac{C^2}{N\;m^2}$

#### More Than 2 Charges
- If we have multiple charges each charge exerts a force on each other
- The total force on a charge is found through [[Vector Addition]]
- This is called the principle of linear superposition
