## Waves
#### [[Superposition and Interference of Waves]]
###### [[Standing wave]]
- Like a string on a guitar. Vibrates back and forth but does not move
- still a tranverse wave
- A guitar string of length L
$$ z(x,t) = A\cos(\omega t)\sin(kx) $$
k = wave number
[[Wavelength]] = $\frac{2\pi}{k}$ 
in general, k = $n\pi/L$ 
n = # of nodes - 1          (Not including ends)

on a standing wave:
- A node is a point where the displacement is always 0
- an anti-node is where the displacement is the largest

$$ \frac{\omega}{k} = v =\sqrt{
\frac{T}{\mu}} 
 $$
 $$ f = \frac{k}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
- $\lambda$ = wavelength


A [[Standing wave]] can also be created by two oppositely moving travelling waves added together (superposition)

Add the equations for the two waves and simplify it and you get the same formula as for a standing wave.
