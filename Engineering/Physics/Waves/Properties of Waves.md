## Properties of Waves:
Examples of Waves:
- [[Light]]
- [[Sound]]

Ocisllations at one point in space drive ocillations at neighboring points

Waves can be thought of as [[Simple Harmonic Motion]] at many different, connected points simultaneously.

##### [[Transverse Wave]]
- Typical wave on a string

##### [[Longitudinal Wave]]
- Think of a spring
- The motion is in the same direction as the direction of the wavelength
- Consists of periodic regions of compression and stretching

##### [[Standing wave]]
- The peaks do not travel but stay in one place
- Their size shrinks and grows periodically

An Ocean wave is a travelling tranverse wave pulse.

##### Describing Wave Motion
Think of it as a wave travelling along a string
$$ y(x,t) = A\cos(kx-\omega t) $$
A = amplitude
$\omega$ = angular frequency = $2\pi/T$
k = wavenumber = $2\pi/\lambda$
$\lambda$ = wavelength = $2\pi/k$

if you set t = 0 you get a sin wave

you can set x = 0 and watch the wave and see a sinusodial variation in time (makes a wave). I think of it as looking at one spot on the string and plotting the y value at that time

you can make a wave travel in the -x direction by changing the sign in front of $\omega t$

Wave Speed:
- In one period T the wave moves a distance $\lambda$
$$ v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f\lambda = \frac{\omega}{k} $$
Therefore:
$$ y(x,t) = A\cos(k(x-vt)) $$

##### Generalization for Travelling waves
$$ y = f(x-vt) $$
The peak always occurs when $x-vt = 0$ 
This pulse moves to the right with a speed $v$
Flip the sign and the wave moves to the left

#### [[Wave Equation]]
We can derive a mathematical description of wave behavior by using [[Newton's Second Law]] In a way that is similar to [[Simple Harmonic Motion]].

The equation we get is:
$$ \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = \frac{T\;d^2z}{\mu \; dx^2} $$
$$ = v^2\frac{d^2z}{dx^2} $$
v = velocity of propogation of the wave

acceleration in the vertical direction is proportional to the square of the wave velocity and the string curvature: $v = \sqrt{T/\mu}$

T = Tension in the string
$\mu$ = mass per unti length of the string

So to check if an equation satisfies the wave equation take the second derivative of the equation with respect to time and with respect to x (seperately) and see if it follows the equation.
