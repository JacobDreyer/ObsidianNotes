## Drift Velocity
- electrons collide and "bounce" around
- When an [[electric field]] is applied the collisions still happen but it creates an average velocity in its direction ([[Current]])
$$ v_d = a\tau $$
- $v_d$ = drift velocity
- $a$ = acceleration
- $\tau$ = time between collisions

We can use this to find [[Current]]:
$$ I = qnv_dA $$
- $n$ = number of charges per unit volume
- $A$ = cross-sectional area
- $q$ = charge on each carrier
- $v_d$ = drift velocity
- $I$ = Current
