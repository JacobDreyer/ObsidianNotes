## Wave Equation
We can derive a mathematical description of wave behavior by using [[Newton's Second Law]] In a way that is similar to [[Simple Harmonic Motion]].

The equation we get is:
$$ \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = \frac{T\;d^2z}{\mu \; dx^2} $$
$$ = v^2\frac{d^2z}{dx^2} $$
v = velocity of propogation of the wave

acceleration in the vertical direction is proportional to the square of the wave velocity and the string curvature: $v = \sqrt{T/\mu}$

T = Tension in the string
$\mu$ = mass per unti length of the string

So to check if an equation satisfies the wave equation take the second derivative of the equation with respect to time and with respect to x (seperately) and see if it follows the equation.
