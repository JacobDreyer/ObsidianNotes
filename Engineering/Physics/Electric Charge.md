## Electric Charge
- There are two types of charges:
	- Positive
	- Negative

- Electric charges from an [[Electric Field]] and exert an [[Electric Force]] on other charges
	- Like charges repel
	- Opposite charges attract

#### Electric Charge and Matter
- [[Matter]] is composed of atoms
- [[Atoms]] are composed of [[protons]] and [[electrons]]
	- Protons carry a positive charge
	- Electrons carry an equal negative charge
- Most Matter is electrically neutral meaning it has the same # of electrons as protons
- This means that removing one of either results in a charge particle/atom

#### [[Conductor]] and [[Insulators]]
- Conductors allow charge to move freely within their interior
	- Some examples include [[metals]] such as aluminum, copper, and gold
- Insulators restrict the movement of [[Electric Charge]]
	- Most [[non-metals]] such as nylon, cotton, and rubber
- [[Semiconductors]] have intermediate properties compared to [[Conductor]] and [[Insulators]]
	- An example of this is Silicon

#### Charging
Charging by [[Induction]]
- This is done by inducing an [[Electric Charge]] on an object without touching it as shown below

Electric Charge can be transferred and total charge is conserved.

#### Electric Charge [[Units]]
- The unit of electric charge is the Coulomb (C)
- Charge on 1 electron:
$$ e = 1.602\cdot 10^{-19} \;C$$
- So you need $6.24\cdot10^{18}$ electrons to make 1 C
- Charge on a proton is the same but opposite
