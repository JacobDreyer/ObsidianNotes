## Kirchhoff's Laws
- Can be used to solve any [[Circuit]]
- One law for [[Voltage]]
- One law for [[Current]]

#### Kirchhoff's Loop Law
- The total change in voltage around a closed loop is zero

- [[Voltage]] increases going through a battery from - to +
- Volatage decreses if we go the other way

- [[Voltage]] decreases going through a resistor in the direction of [[Current]]
- Voltage increases if we go the opposite direction

- If there are $n$ loops we need $n$ loop law equations

#### Kirchhoff's Node Law
- The total [[Current]] into a node equals the total Current out

- a node is where 3 or more wires meet up/branch out
- if there are $n$ nodes we need $n-1$ node law equations
