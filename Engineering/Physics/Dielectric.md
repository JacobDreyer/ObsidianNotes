## Dielectric
- In previous points/formulas we assumed no dielectric (dielectric of air($\kappa$ = 1))
- However the properties change with a dielectric
- a dielectric is an [[Insulators]] sandwiched between the plates of a [[Capacitor]]
- decreases the [[Electric Field]] within the capacitor
- This also decreses [[Potential Difference]] for a given [[electric charge]]
- However it increases the [[Capacitance]]
- Dielectrics are characterized by a dielectric constant $\kappa$
$$ E = \frac{E_0}{\kappa}\qquad V = \frac{V_0}{\kappa}\qquad C = \kappa C_0\qquad U = \frac{U_0}{\kappa} $$
- $E$, $E_0$ = New and original [[Electric Field]]
- $V$, $V_0$ = New and original [[Potential Difference]]
- $C$, $C_0$ = New and original [[Capacitance]]
- $U$, $U_0$ = new and original stored energy ([[Energy and Energy Density in Capacitors]])

- Dielectrics allow larger energy stored at the same or higher voltage

#### Breakdown Field
- the maximum sustainable [[Electric Field]] before the dielectric breaks down
- If the electric field between the plates is too large it can discharge directly into the space between the conductors via an electric arc
- A broken down capacitor can't store energy as it acts like a short circuit
