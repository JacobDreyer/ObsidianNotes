## Circuits
- Can be drawn/illustrated using a [[Circuit Diagram]]
- Net [[Potential Difference]] is 0 around a circuit
	- Gain Voltage through a Battery
	- Lose Voltage across [[Resistors]]
- Properties of circuits can be measuered using [[Electrical Measurements]]
- Can solve complex circuits using [[Kirchhoff's Laws]]


#### Parallel Circuits
- when two elements are connected on sperate paths
![[Pasted image 20220415135843.png]]

Voltage([[Potential Difference]]) of a Parallel Circuit
$$ \Delta V_1 = \Delta V_2 = \Delta V $$

[[Capacitance]] of a Parallel Circuit
$$ C_{eq} = C_1+C_2 $$

[[Current]] in a Parallel Circuit
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 $$

[[Resistors]] in Parallel
$$ R_{eq} = (\frac1{R_1}+\frac1{R_2})^{-1} $$

[[Current]] through [[Resistors]] in Parallel
$$ I_1 = I\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} $$
- $I$ = Current through battery

#### Series Circuits
- When two elements are connected along the same path

Voltage([[Potential Difference]]) of a Series Circuit
$$ \Delta V = \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 $$

[[Capacitance]] of a Series Circuit
$$ \frac1{C_{eq}} = (\frac1{C_1} + \frac1{C_2}) $$

[[Current]] in a Series Circuit
$$ I = I_1 = I_2 $$

Voltage across a Resistor in Series:
$$ V_1 = \frac{\epsilon R_1}{R_1+R_2} $$

[[Resistance]] in a Series Circuit
$$ R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 $$
