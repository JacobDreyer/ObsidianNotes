## Electric Potential
- [[Potential Difference]](V) creates an [[Electric Field]] that can drive an [[Current]]
- Electric Potential is [[Electric Potential Energy]] per unit charge
- ==Electric potential to Electric potential energy== kinda like the ==electric field to electric force==
$$ V = \frac{U}{q_0} = \frac{kq}{r} $$
- $q_0$ = a test charge in [[Electric Field]] of $q$
- U = [[Electric Potential Energy]]

#### Potential Difference
voltage of a battery can tell you how much [[Work]] the battery does on each coulomb of charge.
$$ W = q\Delta V $$
- a positive charge $q_0$ will want to move from regions of higher potential to regions of lower potential
- This is how we get [[Current]]

- Electric Potential due to a charge distribution can be found through adding up the potentials due to each charge in the distribution

#### Potential of a Continuous Charge Distribution
Electric Potential of a Charged Disk
$$ V_P = \frac{2Qk}{a^2}(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}-|x|) $$
- $a$ = radius of disk
- $Q$ = total charge
- $x$ = distance from disk
