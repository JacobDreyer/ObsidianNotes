## Electric Field
- Suppose there is a [[Electric Force]] F acting on an [[Electric Charge]] $q_0$. 
- The electric field (of the other charge causing the force) at the location of $q_0$ is:
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0} $$
- A ==charge produces== an ==electric field==
- The ==field== ==exerts a force on other charges==

$$ \vec{E} = k\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r $$
- Electric field due to charge q at distance r
- if q > 0 the field points away from charge
- if q < 0 the field points toward from charge

- The electric field at a point due to multiple electric fields can be found through [[Vector Addition]] of each field

#### Electric Field Lines
- The density of the lines is proportional to the strength of the electric field
- ==Begin on a positive charge== and ==end on a negative charge==
- No two field lines can cross
