## Simple Pendulum
- Pendulum with all the mass concentrated at a single point

Tangential Force on a simple Pendulum
$$ F_t = -mg\sin\theta $$
- $m$ = mass
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity = 9.81
- $\theta$ = angle between string direction and gravity direction(straight up and down)
- $F_t$ = tangential force (force causing swinging)

Arc Length from [[Equilibrium]] point to Bob Position
$$ s = l\theta $$
- $s$ = Arc Length
- $l$ = length of string
- $\theta$ = angle between string and string at equilibrium

Tangential Acceleration
$$ a = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = l\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} $$
- $s$ = Arc Length
- $\theta$ = angle between string and string at equilibrium
- $a$ = tangential accleration

Acceleration of Angle
$$ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\frac gl\sin\theta $$
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity = 9.81
- $l$ = length of string
- $\theta$ = angle between string and string at equilibrium

[[Simple Pendulum]] Equation
$$ \theta(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \varphi) $$
- $\theta$ = angle between string and string at equilibrium
- $A$ = [[Amplitude]]
- $\varphi$ = phase constant (shift)
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Frequency]]

[[Angular Frequency]] of a [[Simple Pendulum]]
$$ \omega = \sqrt\frac gl $$
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity = 9.81
- $l$ = length of string


- A Pendulum is the same as a [[Mass-Spring System]] just swap:
$$ x\Leftrightarrow\theta $$
$$ k\Leftrightarrow g $$
$$ m\Leftrightarrow l $$
