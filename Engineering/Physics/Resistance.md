## Resistance
- generally created in [[Circuit]] using [[Resistors]]
$$ R = \frac{\rho l}{A} $$
- $R$ = resistance
- $\rho$ = [[Resistivity]]
- $l$ = length of wire
- $A$ = Cross-sectional area

[[Ohm's Law]]
$$ R = \frac{\Delta V}{I} $$
- $\Delta V$ = Voltage ([[Potential Difference]])
- $I$ = [[Current]]

The Inverse of resistance is [[Conductance]]
