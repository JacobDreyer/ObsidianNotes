## Eddy Currents
- Induced [[Current]] in a solid [[Conductor]]
- Can be quite large and dissipate lots of [[Energy]] (as heat)
- cause a "magnetic [[friction]]"

- Conductor travelling in [[Magnetic Field]]
	- Magnetic field into page. Velocity to left
	- Force on charges point down; Thus downward current
	- Downward [[Current]] in magnetic field creates a [[Magnetic Force]] to the right (found using formula and [[Right Hand Rule]])

#### Inhibiting Eddy Currents
- Slots make it harder for eddy currents to form
- They only allow smaller eddy currents which reduces the strength of the induced field
