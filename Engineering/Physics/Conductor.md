## Conductors
- Conductors allow [[Electric Charge]] to move freely within their interior
	- Some examples include [[metals]] such as aluminum, copper, and gold

- When conductors have a charge the excess [[electrons]] repel each other
- As a result the charge on a conductor resides on the surface

- This affects how [[Conductors in Electric Fields]] Behave

#### In [[Circuit]]s
Ideal conductors are represented in [[Circuit Diagram]]s by unbroken lines between the ends of other circuit elements

We define ideal circuit elements in terms of the relationship between [[Voltage]] across the element and the current through it.

The voltage between the ends of an ideal conductor is zero regardless of the [[Current]] flowing through it.

This means the [[Resistance]] in an ideal conductor is 0

When two points in a circuit are connected together by an ideal conductor, we say the points are SHORTED together

If no conductors or other circuit elements are connected between two parts of a circuit we say that an OPEN CIRCUIT exists (no current can flow through an open circuit)
