## Resistivity
- The inverse of conductivity($\sigma$)
- the unit of resistivity($\rho$) is the Ohm-meter: $\ohm m$ 

conductivity:
$$ \sigma = \frac{q^2n\tau}{m} $$
- $q$ = charge on each carrier
- $n$ = number of charges per unit volume
- $\tau$ = time between collisions
- $m$ = mass
- $E$ = [[Electric Field]]

[[Resistance]]:
$$ R = \frac{\rho l}{A} $$
- $R$ = resistance
- $\rho$ = resistivity
- $l$ = length of wire
- $A$ = Cross-sectional area
