## [[Resistors]] [[Capacitor]] [[Circuit]]
#### Series RC Circuit
Current:
$$ I(t) = I(0)e^{-t/RC} $$
- $I(0)$ = Original Current
- $t$ = time
- $R$ = [[Resistance]] of [[Circuit]]
- C = [[Capacitance]] of [[Capacitor]]

- RC is called the time constant of the circuit

[[Voltage]] across [[Capacitor]] as it charges
$$ V_C = \epsilon(1-e^{-t/RC}) $$
- $\epsilon$ = [[Electromotive Force]] (emf)
- $t$ = time
- $R$ = Resistance
- $C$ = Capacitance

[[Voltage]] across [[Capacitor]] when Discharging a RC circuit
$$ V_C = V_0e^{-t/RC} $$
- $V_0$ = starting voltage
- $t$ = time
- $R$ = Resistance
- $C$ = Capacitance
