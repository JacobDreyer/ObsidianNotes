## Solenoids
- Are used to create a controled [[magnetic field]] within a coil by passing a [[Current]] through the coil
- creates a magnetic field within the coild but no field on the outside
#### [[Magnetic Field]] in a Solenoids
$$ B = \frac{\mu_0NI}{2R} = \mu_0nI $$
- $n$ = # of loops per unit length
- $N$ = Number of Loops
- $I$ = [[Current]]
- $\mu_0$ = [[Permeability Constant]] = $4\pi\cdot10^{-7}$ ($T\; m/A$) or ($N/A^2$)
