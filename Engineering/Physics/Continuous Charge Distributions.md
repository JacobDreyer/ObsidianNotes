## Continuous Charge Distributions
- It is impractical to claculate the contribution of each individual [[electric charge]]
- so we treat the charge as being smeared out across the object
- we can then calculate the contribution of each small piece to the electric field using [[Integral]] in a method similar to [[Volumes By Slicing]]

#### Given Equations for Continuous Charge Distributions
Electric field at the end of a finite charged wire:
$$ \vec E = -k\frac{Q}{a(l+a)}\hat i $$
- $l$ = length of wire
- $a$ = distance from end of wire
- $Q$ = total [[electric charge]] of wire

Electric field perpindicularly from an infite charged wire
$$ \vec E = \frac{2k\lambda}{r}\hat r $$
- points radially away from wire
- $\lambda$ = linear charge density
- $r$ = distance from wire (perpindicularly)

Electric field from an infinite plane of charge
$$ \vec E = 2\pi k\sigma\hat y $$
- $\sigma$ = charge per unit area
- points perpindicularly away from plane

On-Axis Electric field due to a ring of charge
$$ \vec E = \frac{kxQ}{(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}} \hat{x}$$
- $Q$ = total charge
- $a$ = radius of ring
- $x$ = distance from ring
- Points away along axis of ring
