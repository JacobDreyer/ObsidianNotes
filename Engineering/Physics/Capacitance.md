## Capacitance
- Is a poroperty of [[Capacitor]]
- Is defined as:
$$ C = Q/V = A\epsilon_0/d $$
$$ \epsilon = \epsilon_0\epsilon_r $$
- $A\epsilon/d$ (For a [[Parallel-Plate Capacitor]])
- $Q$ = total charge
- $V$ = [[Potential Difference]]
- $A$ = Area
- $\epsilon_0$ = [[Permittivity of Free Space]] = $8.854\cdot10^{-12}\; \frac{C^2}{N\;m^2}$
- $\epsilon_r$ = depends on the [[Dielectric]] material used between the plates and called the [[Relative Dielectric Constant]]
- $d$ = distance between plates

- From this we can see that capacitance only depends on ==the geometry of the [[Capacitor]]==
- C is the charge stored on the plate per volt of potential difference across the plates
- Units = (C/V) = Farads(F) = Coullomb/Volt
- most capacitors are rated in the pF(picofarad) - mF(milifarad) range
