## Potential Difference
To move [[electrons]] in a conductor is a particular direction requires some work or energy transfer.
This work is performed by the [[Electromotive Force]] (emf) typically represented by the battery
This emf is also known as the [[Voltage]] or Potential Difference

The voltage $v_{ab}$ between 2 points $a$ and $b$ is the energy/work needed to move a unit charge from a to b:
$$ v_{a b} \triangleq\frac{dw}{dq} $$
where $w$ is [[Energy]] in Joules and q is charge in [[Coulombs]]


The difference in [[Electric Potential]] between two points
$$ \Delta V = -\int_A^B \vec{E}\cdot d\vec s$$
Potential Difference between two plates
$$ \Delta V = El $$
- $l$ = distance between the plates

[[Electric Field]] between two plates becomes:
$$ E = \Delta V/l $$
- $l$ = distance between the 2 plates
