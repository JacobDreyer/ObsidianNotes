## Magnetic Field
- Similar to that of an [[Electric Field]]
- Magnetic fields also result in a [[Magnetic Force]] but only on moving [[Electric Charge]]s
- The field looks like a [[electric dipole]] 
	- they point away from the north pole to the south pole

- [[Current]]s create magnetic fields

Moving Charges ([[Current]]) -> Magnetic Fields -> Force on Moving Charges
