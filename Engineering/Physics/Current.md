## Electric Current
- Defined as the amount of charge passing a point in a time interval
$$ I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} $$
- Current in [[Circuit]] flow in the direction of positive [[electric charge]]
- [[electrons]] move opposite to the direction of current
- Units: C/s = Ampere(Amps)(A)

[[Current]] in Parallel [[Circuit]]
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 $$

[[Current]] in Series [[Circuit]]
$$ I = I_1 = I_2 $$

Electric Current using [[Drift Velocity]]:
$$ I = qnv_dA $$
- $n$ = number of charges per unit volume
- $A$ = cross-sectional area
- $q$ = charge on each carrier
- $v_d$ = drift velocity
- $I$ = Current

#### Current Density
$$ J = \frac{I}{A} = qnv_d = \frac{q^2n\tau}{m}E = \sigma E $$
- $q$ = charge on each carrier
- $v_d$ = [[Drift Velocity]]
- $n$ = number of charges per unit volume
- $\tau$ = time between collisions
- $m$ = mass
- $E$ = [[Electric Field]]
- $\sigma$ = conductivity (inverse of [[Resistivity]])

$$ I = \sigma AE $$

#### [[Ohm's Law]]
$$ I = \frac{\Delta V}{R} $$
- $\Delta V$ = [[Potential Difference]](Voltage)
- $R$ = [[Resistance]]

#### Transferred Charge
The charge transferred between time $t_0$ to $t$ sec is given by:
$$ q(t)\triangleq\int_{t_0}^ti(t)dt + q(t_0) $$
#### [[Direct Current]]
(DC)
A current that remains constant with time.

#### [[Alternating Current]]
(AC)
A current that varies with time, reversing direction periodically.
