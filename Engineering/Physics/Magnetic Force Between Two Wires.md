## [[Magnetic Force]] Between Two Wires
$$ \frac FL = \frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi d} $$
- $F$ = [[Magnetic Force]] (acts on each wire)
- $\mu_o$ = [[Permeability Constant]] = $4\pi\cdot10^{-7}$ ($T\; m/A$) or ($N/A^2$)
- $I_1$, $I_2$ = Current of wires
- $d$ = distance between wires
- $L$ = Length of wires
- $I_1$ and $I_2$ same direction -> Force is attractive
- $I_1$ and $I_2$ opposite direction -> Force is repulsive
