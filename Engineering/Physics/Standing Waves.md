## Standing Waves
Wave that doesnt move but oscillates up and down

Described by:
$$ z(x,t) = A\cos(\omega t)\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) $$
- $L$ = length of string
- $n$ = # of nodes - 1 (including ends)
- $\lambda$ = wave length = $2\pi/k$ = $2L/n$

a node is where the displacement is always 0

Frequency:
$$ f = \frac{k}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
- $L$ = length of string
- $n$ = # of nodes - 1 (including ends)
- $\lambda$ = wave length = $2\pi/k$ = $2L/n$
- $T$ = tension in string
- $\mu$ = mass per unit length of string
