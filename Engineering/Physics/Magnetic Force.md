## Magnetic Force
#### Magnetic Force on a Single Charge
- Particles with an [[Electric Charge]] $q$ that travels with velocity $\vec v$ in a [[Magnetic Field]] experience a magnetic force:
$$ \vec F = q\vec v\times\vec B =qvB\sin\theta $$
- $q$ = [[Electric Charge]]
- $\vec v$ = velocity
- $\vec B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]

- [[The Cross Product]] between $\vec v$ and $\vec B$ times $q$
- $B$ has the units: Tesla (T)
- The direction is given by the [[Right Hand Rule]]
	- point fingers in direction of $\vec v$
	- Curl in direction of $\vec B$
	- thumb points in direction of magnetic force
- The magnetic force can only change a charge's direction
- The magnetic force does no [[Work]]

Radius of Circular motion due to Magnetic Force
$$ r = \frac{mv}{|q|B} $$
- $m$ = mass
- $v$ = velocity of charge
- $q$ = charge of charge
- $B$ = magnetic field magnitude

Period to complete one circular orbit
$$ T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B} $$
- $r$ = radius of circular motion
- $m$ = mass
- $v$ = speed of charge
- $q$ = charge of charge
- $B$ = Magnetic field magnitude

[[Frequency]]:
$$ f = \frac1T $$
- $T$ = Period

#### Magnetic Force on an [[Current]] Carrying [[Conductor]]
$$ F = I\vec L\times\vec B = ILB\sin(\theta) $$
- $I$ = [[Current]]
- $L$ = Length of [[Conductor]]
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $\theta$ = angle between $B$ and $L$
