## Equipotential
- Lines of constant [[Electric Potential]]
- The [[Electric Potential Energy]] U is the same anywhere on an equipotential
	- therfore travelling along one also results in no [[Work]] being done by the [[Electric Field]]
- The Electric Field is always perpindicular to equipotentials
- Can not intersect
