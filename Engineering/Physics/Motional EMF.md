## Motional EMF
- Generated whenever a [[Conductor]] moves in an [[Electric Field]]

Slider Moving in a [[Magnetic Field]]
$$ \epsilon = -BvL $$
- $\epsilon$ = [[Electromotive Force]]
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $v$ = speed slider is travelling at
- $L$ = Length of slider

$$ E = vB $$
- $E$ = [[Electric Field]]
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $v$ = speed slider is travelling at

$$ V_{ab} = BvL $$
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $v$ = speed slider is travelling at
- $L$ = Length of slider
- $V_{ab}$ = Potential difference between ends of slider
