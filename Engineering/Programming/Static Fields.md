## Static Fields
#### Static Methods
Static methods allow a method belonging to a class to be called from outside without creating a new reference variable of the class.

Instead you can call it with code like:

MyClass.myMethod()

They are typically used to create "utility methods" such as Math.sqrt()

A static method can only access static data fields in the same class
