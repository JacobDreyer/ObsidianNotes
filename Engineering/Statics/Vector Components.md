## Vector Components
###### Version 1:

$$ \cos\alpha = \frac{A_x}{A}\qquad \cos\beta = \frac{A_y}{A}\qquad \cos\gamma = \frac{A_z}{A} $$
- $\alpha$ (alpha) is the angle between the vector and the x axis
- $\beta$ (beta) is the angle between the vector and the y axis
- $\gamma$ (gamma) is the angle between the vector and the z axis

###### Version 2:

$$ A_z = A\cos\phi \qquad A' = A\sin\phi $$
$$ A_x = A\sin\phi\cos\theta\qquad A_y = A\sin\phi\sin\theta $$
