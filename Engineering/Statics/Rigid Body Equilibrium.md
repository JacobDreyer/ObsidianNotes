## Equilibrium of a Rigid Body
- Forces can create moments and rotation on a rigid body so we must also make sure these are equal
$$ \sum F_x = 0 \qquad \sum F_y = 0 \qquad \sum F_z = 0 $$
$$  \sum M_x = 0 \qquad \sum M_y = 0 \qquad \sum M_z = 0  $$
- This yields six equations allowing us to solve for six unknowns
- For a 2D system we have 3 equations allowing us to solve for 3 unknowns
