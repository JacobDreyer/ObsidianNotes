## Tipping
- The block(object) may tip before it slides

##### Critical Sliding Force
Consider a Block:
![[Pasted image 20220331134641.png]]
The [[equilibrium equations]] for this block are:
$$ \sum F_x = N-W = 0 $$
$$ \sum F_y = P-\mu_sN = 0 $$
$$ \sum M = -Ph + Wx = 0 $$
Solve for N, P, and x. if $x<b/2$ then the block will slide before it tips

In this case the [[Moments]] is being taken about the point at the bootom of the box and in the centre.

##### Critical Tipping Force
Consider the same block:
if the block is about to tip then $x = b/2$ 

x and y equilibrium equations remain the same but the moment becomes:
$$ \sum M = -Ph + W(b/2) = 0 $$
Solve for P, F, and N

if $F < \mu_sN$ then the block will tip before it slides
