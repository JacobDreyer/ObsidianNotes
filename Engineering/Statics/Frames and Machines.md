## Frames and Machines
#### [[Frames]]
- A frame is a structure made up of members connected by pins and subjects to loads and moments
- Are stationary and designed to support loads
- If the entire frame is in [[equilibrium]] then each of the members must also be in equilibrium
- Therefore we can calculate the forces acting at the joints and supports by applying the [[Equilibrium Equations]] to each member

#### [[Machines]]
- Structures of pin connected members subjected to multiple forces (like [[Frames]])
- Unlike frames they move and are used to transmit and change the effect of forces (Input Forces -> Output Forces)

###### Procedure for Analysis
- Identify [[Two-Force Members]]
- Draw appropriate [[Free Body Diagrams]] involving all required unknowns
- Count number of unknowns and number of [[Equilibrium Equations]]
- If neccessary draw additional external FBDs of detached members until # of unknowns = # of equilibrium equations
- Write the set of simultaneous equilibrium equations for all the FBDs you have drawn
- Solve for unknowns
