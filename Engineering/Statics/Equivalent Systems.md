## Equivalent Systems
- Reduce a system of forces and couple moments acting on a body to a simpler form by replacing it with an equivalent system
- Can combine a system of forces into 1 force and 1 moment. Or one force olcated at a certain point

#### Moving a Force
- You can feely move a force along its line of action
- To move it off its line of action you must introduce a moment
- If you have a moment and a force at a certain point in order to get rid of the moment: move the force off the line to create an equivalent system
- Distance to move can be found by $M = Fd$ -> $\frac{M}{F} = d$

#### [[Distributed Loading]]
- The equivalent force is equal to the area of the distributed load force
- The location of the force is:
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\int xdA}{\int dA} $$
- A is area of the distributed load force
- A rectangle distributed load is simple and easy to understand
- A triangle distributed load magnitude is straight forward. The resultant force is located L/3 from the high side of the triangle
