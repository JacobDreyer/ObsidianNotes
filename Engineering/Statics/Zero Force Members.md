## Zero Force Members
- Zero force members are members which support no load
- Can be found:
	- if 2 members form a joint where there is no external load or support reactions then both are zero force members
	- If 3 members form a joint and 2 of the members are collinear and there is no external load or support reactions then the third member is a zero force member
