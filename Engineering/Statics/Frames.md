## Frames
- A frame is a structure made up of members connected by pins and subjects to loads and moments
- Are stationary and designed to support loads
- If the entire frame is in [[equilibrium]] then each of the members must also be in equilibrium
- Therefore we can calculate the forces acting at the joints and supports by applying the [[Equilibrium Equations]] to each member
