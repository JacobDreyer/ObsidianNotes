## Internal Forces
- To determine the internal forces in a member we use the [[Method of Sections]] to split the beam at a point

N = normal force   or   axial force
- positive if it places the beam it acts on in tension (N shown above is +)

V = shear force
- positive if it causes the beam it acts on to rotate clockwise (V shown above is +)

M = bending moment
- positive if it bends the beam it acts on in a concave up direction (M shown above is positive)

#### Shear Force and Bending Moment Equations and Diagrams

Slopes of the graphs:

The slope of the shear force diagram is given by:
$$ \frac{dV}{dx} = w(x) $$
$$ \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = w(x) $$
Change in shear force equals the area under the distributed load curve


The slope of the bending moment diagram is given by:
$$ \frac{dM}{dx} = V $$
Change in bending moment between 2 points equals the area under the shear force diagram
