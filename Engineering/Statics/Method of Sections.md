## Method of Sections
- Used to find internal forces of a system similarly to [[Method of Joints]]
- "Slice" the system along the members you want to find (max of 3)
- draw a [[Free Body Diagrams]] for a piece.
- Apply the [[Equilibrium equations]] to solve for the unknown forces

- When solving the [[Equilibrium Equations]], remember to start with moments about a point that lies at the intersection of the lines of action of two of the unknown truss member forces which will yield a direct result for the third unknown force
