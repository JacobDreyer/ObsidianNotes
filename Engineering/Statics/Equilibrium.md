# Equilibrium
- Pretty simple concept; make sure all forces and moments add up to 0

### [[Equilibrium of a Particle]]
- The sum of all forces equal 0
$$ \sum F_x = 0 \qquad \sum F_y = 0 \qquad \sum F_z = 0 $$
###### 3D:
We have 3 scalar equilibrium equations so we solve for at most 3 unknowns in a 3D system

###### 2D:
We have 2 scalar equilibrium equations so we solve for at most 2 unknowns in a 2D system

### [[Rigid Body Equilibrium]]
- Forces can create moments and rotation on a rigid body so we must also make sure these are equal
$$ \sum F_x = 0 \qquad \sum F_y = 0 \qquad \sum F_z = 0 $$
$$  \sum M_x = 0 \qquad \sum M_y = 0 \qquad \sum M_z = 0  $$
- This yields six equations allowing us to solve for six unknowns
- For a 2D system we have 3 equations allowing us to solve for 3 unknowns

### Procedure For Analysis
Draw the [[Free Body Diagrams]]
Write the Equilibrium equations

##### Forces in [[Springs]]
- $F = ks$
- s is the displacement
