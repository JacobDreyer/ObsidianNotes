Used to understand the forces acting on an object

### [[Cables, Wires, and Pulleys]]
- Can only act in tension
- Have negiligible weight 
- Do not stretch
- Cables and wire acting over a frictionless pulley have the same force acting everwhere throughout the cable
- Tension is constant through out the cable

### [[Springs]]
- can act in either tension or compression

### [[Support Reactions]]
- A roller/rocker on produces a normal force perpindicular to the surface it is resting on
- A Pin or hinge produces a reaction force in both x and y direction
- Doesn't procduce a moment reaction

### [[Two-Force Members]]
- Has forces applied to only 2 points on the member
- To be in [[Equilibrium]] a two-force member has to have both forces acting along the same line of action (in opposite directions) and have the same [[Vector Magnitude]]

### [[Three-Force Members]]
- Has forces applied to 3 points on the member
- To be in [[Equilibrium]] the three forces must either be concurrent (all can intersect at a single point) or parrallel

### [[Multi-Member Bodies]]
- When drawing Free Body diagrams for the pieces of a multi-member body you have to start drawing the internal reaction forces
- These forces must follow [[Newton's Third Law]]. The internal reaction forces must be equal and opposite for connected members
