Based on: [[Frames and Machines]]

## Machines
- Structures of pin connected members subjected to multiple forces (like [[Frames]])
- Unlike frames they move and are used to transmit and change the effect of forces (Input Forces -> Output Forces)

###### Procedure for Analysis
- Identify [[Two-Force Members]]
- Draw appropriate [[Free Body Diagrams]] involving all required unknowns
- Count number of unknowns and number of [[Equilibrium Equations]]
- If neccessary draw additional external FBDs of detached members until # of unknowns = # of equilibrium equations
- Write the set of simultaneous equilibrium equations for all the FBDs you have drawn
- Solve for unknowns
