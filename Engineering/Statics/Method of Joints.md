## Method of Joints
- each joint is in equilibrium so we can use the equilibrium equations to determine the forces acting on the joints
- $\sum M = 0$ is automatically satisfied. We only need to use $\sum F_x = 0$ and $\sum F_y = 0$

 ###### Procedure
 - Draw [[Free Body Diagrams]] for the joints (and entire system if you want)
 - Pick a FBD having at least 1 known force and at most 2 unknowns
 - Apply equilibrium equations
 - Remember a tension member pulls on a joint and a compression member pushes on a joint
 - Move to the next joint
