## Equilibrium of a Particle

- The sum of all forces equal 0
$$ \sum F_x = 0 \qquad \sum F_y = 0 \qquad \sum F_z = 0 $$
###### 3D:
We have 3 scalar equilibrium equations so we solve for at most 3 unknowns in a 3D system

###### 2D:
We have 2 scalar equilibrium equations so we solve for at most 2 unknowns in a 2D system
