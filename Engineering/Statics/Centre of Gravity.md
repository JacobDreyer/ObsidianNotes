## Centre of Gravity
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\int x\cdot\rho\cdot dV}{\int\rho\cdot dV} $$
- Do this for each COM coordinate needed (x, y, z)

### [[Centroids]]
- The centre of gravity of a body with a constant density
- Can be used to find volume of surface area using [[Pappus's Theorem]]
- it can be found by using [[Calculus]] to find the [[Volumes By Slicing]]
- of a volume:
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\int xdV}{\int dV} \qquad \bar{y} = \frac{\int ydV}{\int dV} \qquad \bar{z} = \frac{\int zdV}{\int dV}$$
- of an area:
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\int xdA}{\int dA} \qquad \bar{y} = \frac{\int ydA}{\int dA}$$
### COG of Composite Bodies
- These are bodies that can be broken down into simple shapes

##### Procedure for Analysis
- Determine Location of COG
- Use formula like this:
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum xA}{\sum A} $$
- x = x corrdinate of centroid for that piece
- A = Area of each segment
