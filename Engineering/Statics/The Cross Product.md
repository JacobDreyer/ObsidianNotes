([[Cartesian Product]])
$$ C = A\times B = |A||B|\sin\theta $$
The direction of C is perpindicular to the plane that A and B are on. It creates a vector that is perpindicular to both A and B.

The direction can be found using the [[Right Hand Rule]].

Can also be calculated like this:

$$ = (A_zB_x - B_zA_x)\hat{j} $$
$$ = (A_yB_z - B_yA_z)\hat{i} + (A_zB_x - B_zA_x)\hat{j} $$
z component:

$$ = (A_xB_y-B_xA_y)\hat{k} $$
$$ A\times B = (A_yB_z - B_yA_z)\hat{i} + (A_zB_x - B_zA_x)\hat{j} + (A_xB_y-B_xA_y)\hat{k} $$
