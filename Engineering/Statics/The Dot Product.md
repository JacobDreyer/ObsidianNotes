## The Dot Product
$$ A\cdot B = |A||B|\cos\theta = A_xB_x + A_yB_y + A_zB_z$$
$\theta$ (theta) = the angle between the two vectors

Can be used to find the component of the vector acting along a specific direction by doing the dot product of the vector and the unit vector of the direction you want to find.

The magnitude of the component perpindicular the what was found above can be found by:
$$ A_\perp = \sqrt{A^2 - A_{||}^2} $$
The vector form can be found by:
$$ A_\perp = A-A_{||} $$
