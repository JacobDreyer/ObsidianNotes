## Distributed Loading
- The equivalent force is equal to the area of the distributed load force
- Might need to be found by using [[Integral]]
- The location of the force is found using [[Integral]]:
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\int xdA}{\int dA} $$
- A is area of the distributed load force
- A rectangle distributed load is simple and easy to understand
- A triangle distributed load magnitude is straight forward. The resultant force is located L/3 from the high side of the triangle
