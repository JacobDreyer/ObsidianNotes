## Friction
- [[Force]] that resists motion
- Static Friction (when the object is stationary) is generally greater than kinetic friction (when the object is already moving)
### Static Friction
$$ F_s = N\mu_s $$
- N = Normal Force
- $\mu_s$ = coefficient of static friction

- Friction that occurs when the object is stationary

### Kinetic Friction
$$ F_k = N\mu_k $$
- $\mu_k$ = coefficient of kinetic friction

- Friction that occurs when the object is sliding (I think thats the right equation for kinetic?)

### [[Tipping]]
- The block(object) may tip before it slides

##### Critical Sliding Force
Consider a Block:
![[Pasted image 20220331134641.png]]
The [[equilibrium equations]] for this block are:
$$ \sum F_x = N-W = 0 $$
$$ \sum F_y = P-\mu_sN = 0 $$
$$ \sum M = -Ph + Wx = 0 $$
Solve for N, P, and x. if $x<b/2$ then the block will slide before it tips

In this case the [[Moments]] is being taken about the point at the bootom of the box and in the centre.

##### Critical Tipping Force
Consider the same block:
if the block is about to tip then $x = b/2$ 

x and y equilibrium equations remain the same but the moment becomes:
$$ \sum M = -Ph + W(b/2) = 0 $$
Solve for P, F, and N

if $F < \mu_sN$ then the block will tip before it slides

### Wedges

### Belts
- Frictional forces on flat belts

$$ T_2 = T_1e^{\mu\beta} $$
- $\mu$ = coefficient of friction
- $\beta$ = amount of angle the belt is touching the surface
