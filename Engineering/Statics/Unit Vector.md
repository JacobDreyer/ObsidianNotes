## Unit Vector
- A [[Unit Vector]] is a vector with any direction and a magnitude of 1
	- Represented by a hat on top of the variable
	- $\hat{i}$  is the unit vector along the x axis, $\hat{j}$ is along the y axis, and $\hat{k}$ is along the z axis

The unit Vector of a direction or other vector can be calculated as:
$$ \hat A = \frac{A_x}{|A|}\hat{i} + \frac{A_y}{|A|}\hat{j} + \frac{A_z}{|A|}\hat{k} $$
Can be used to find the component form of a vector given the magnitude. It is simply the magnitude times each component of the unit vector.
