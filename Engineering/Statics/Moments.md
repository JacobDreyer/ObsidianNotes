# Moments
- A measure of the rotational effect/force
- Torque; Like a wrench turning a bolt

#### Moment of a Force in 3D
- Can be calculated using [[the cross product]]: $M_O = r\times F$
- r is a position vector from O to any point along the line of action of F

#### Moment of a Force in 2D
- The magnitude of a moment can be found by: $M_O = Fd$
- where d is the "moment arm". a line/length perpindicular to F that intersects with O
- the shortest length between the vector and O

- Usually A moment in the clockwise direction is negative and a moment in the counter-clockwise direction is positive.
- The resultant moment of multiple moments is simply the sum of the moments

###### Break it into Components
- To make it even easieryou can break the F up into its x and y components and same with d.
- Then find the moments due to the components and sum them up.

#### [[Moment of a Couple]]
A couple is two parallel Force vectors with the same magnitude pointing in opposite direction.

The Moment of a couple is: $M_O = Fd$

If the couple moment is acting on a rigid body it has the same external effect on the body no matter where it is located
